AB Although there is an increase in research into how narrative identity interrelates with embodiment, the mechanisms underlying this interplay are hardly addressed. In this paper, I target this hiatus in the literature by proposing two mechanisms that can help to (non-exhaustively) elucidate the dynamic interplay of narrative identity and embodiment. I start by briefly sketching the debate so far and then go on to argue that the way narrative self-understanding affects our embodiment can be understood on the model of narrative self-programming. After that I turn to the other side of the interaction. Drawing on research in ecological psychology and phenomenology, I show how embodiment affects our narrative self-understanding through the way in which we engage with affordances in our narrative background. After that I highlight the dynamic and recursive character of this interplay. I end with some conclusions and unresolved issues.

AB Building owners' appropriate risk-mitigation decisions can minimize the social, economic, and socioeconomic consequences of earthquakes. Implementation of appropriate policies can increase the adoption of seismic retrofit measures through the modification of owners' beliefs. Social interactions among owners can influence their response to the implemented policies. There is a need for appropriate tools that consider the social interactions among the owners and facilitate the evaluation of their response to seismic retrofit promotion policies. The agent-based simulation model in this manuscript addresses this need. The implementation of policies and interactions among agents can influence agent's attributes. In this model, a set of behavior functions determine the impact of adjustments in owners' attributes on their intentions and decisions. The relative agreement model used in the model characterizes the impact of agent interactions on their beliefs. The model outputs illustrate the gradual changes in the behavior of individual owners and their aggregate response to the implemented policy interventions. The capabilities of the proposed model are showcased by using an illustrative example. The example provides valuable insights on the diffusion of the impact of policies through society due to the agents' interactions and shows that interactions among agents can enhance or nullify the impact of the implemented policies, based on the attitudes of the majority. Practitioners can use the proposed agent-based model to design new policies and select appropriate implementation mechanisms that effectively increase the adoption of risk-mitigation measures and enhance the resilience of communities.

AB The objective of this research is to explore young adults' e-waste recycling behaviour cross-culturally using an extended Theory of planned Behaviour (TPB) model. The results of a survey involving respondents from the two culturally-distinct emerging markets showed that the key influencing factors that influenced e-waste recycling behaviour amongst young adults were: Attitude (moderated by a Sense of Duty), Perceived Control, Subjective Norm and Individual Responsibility whereas Convenience and Consequences Awareness constructs did not have significant influence. Cross-cultural differences were also evident as stronger relationships were witnessed for Perceived Control and Subjective Norm constructs for the Chinese young adults' intention to recycle e-waste. The reverse was found to be true for Attitude (moderated by a Sense of Duty) and Individual Responsibility constructs where stronger relationships were observed in the Indian sample. This research makes a valuable theoretical contribution as it is positioned at the intersection of cross-cultural studies, sustainability and reverse supply chain management areas. This study has practical implication at two levels: the individual actor level and the supply chain level as consumers' intentions to recycle, underpinned by responsibility towards environment, directly impact the performance of reverse supply chains.

AB Personal carbon trading is a downstream version of the cap and trade approaches to mitigating carbon emissions from individual energy use. Although there are studies that investigate the theoretical and implementation issues, there is little evidence over the potential ways people could reduce their emissions when subject to a PCT policy. Especially little is understood about how people make tradeoff between or complement reducing emissions from transport and in-home energy use. This paper addresses this gap by reporting the findings of a questionnaire survey of stated intentions under the policy. Results show that, more people (53.6%) preferred to reduce their emissions from both transport and in-home energy use compared to from only one of these. This shows the flexibility offered by a cap including transport and in-home energy use is more efficient compared to a PCT covering either of these separately. Nearly three-fourths (76.2%) opted to reduce their emissions following a PCT policy. However, among those with above-budget initial emissions, a large share (79.6%) still could not reduce their emissions to below the budget and opted to purchase at least some permits to cover their emissions, indicating the difficulty in reducing emissions at the personal and household level.

AB People with HIV are living longer. However, co-morbidities are often more prevalent and severe than in the general population and have greater impacts on health status. Although compelling evidence exists about the health benefits of exercise in the HIV literature, many people living with HIV tend to be physically inactive. The purpose of this study was to use the Theoretical Domains Framework to investigate the barriers and facilitators to participation in exercise of older people living with HIV. This qualitative study involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 adults aged 45 years and older recruited from HIV organizations and health centres. Data were analyzed thematically using the Theoretical Domains Framework, and two investigators independently coded transcripts. Six prominent domains were identified from the interviews: Social influences, environmental context and resources, reinforcement, intentions, social and professional role, and knowledge. Themes emerging from the interviews fit into all 14 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, and 67% of themes fit into the six most prominent domains. The participants had a working knowledge of exercise and its health benefits but were unfamiliar with specific exercise parameters. The majority identified environmental or resource constraints as salient barriers for participation in exercise programmes. Co-morbidities, injuries, and the side effects of HIV disease and medication were also acknowledged as barriers. Stigma and discrimination from friends, family, people within the LGBTQ community, and health care providers were commonly discussed. Participants spoke of the importance of social support to facilitate participation in exercise programmes. Other facilitators included using technology and incorporating exercise into day-to-day activities. People aging with HIV experience many barriers to exercise. Those designing exercise interventions for people aging with HIV should incorporate strategies to address these obstacles.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the extent of green initiatives within manufacturing SMEs, as well as the mediating effect of the owners/managers intention toward green and moderating effect of green technology adoption in building environmental sustainability in the context of the Malaysian manufacturing SMEs. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a survey questionnaire responded by 260 Malaysian manufacturing SMEs. The relationships proposed in the developed conceptual framework were represented through three hypotheses: there is a significant relationship between green initiatives and environmental sustainability (H1); intention toward green mediates the relationship between green initiatives and environmental sustainability (H2); and green technology adoption moderates the relationship between intention toward green and environmental sustainability (H3). SEM-AMOS nested model comparisons and mediating and moderating analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings This is the first research toward the green initiatives framework for the manufacturing SMEs. Till date, no framework is available which could guide researchers and practitioners of this high impact on the environment industry. The findings revealed that energy management, water conservation and waste management are related to environmental sustainability. On mediation analysis, it confirms that owners/managers intention toward green fully mediates the association of green initiatives and environmental sustainability. Finally, the moderation analysis revealed that green technology adoption does not have an influence on manufacturing SMEs environmental sustainability. Practical implications This study is expected to help both researchers and practitioners in terms of manufacturing and other industries who are serious toward environmental sustainability implementation and are looking for an appropriate mechanism. It offers a generalized environmental sustainability implementation linking SMEs owners/managers, green practices, green technology policy, process management and supply chain management. Originality/value This study is among the very first environmental sustainability implementation research works conducted in the Malaysian manufacturing sector, particularly, in relation to the green initiatives and "four pillars" of green technology policy that manufacturing SMEs in this country need to adopt to make their environmental sustainability a solid competitive vehicle for their development. The results have broader implications for all manufacturing SMEs, particularly in developing economies where the growth of manufacturing and the development of integrated environmental sustainability are key stages in economic development.

AB The high prevalence of sexual assault in US college campuses has led to a widespread implementation of bystander intervention programs aimed at preventing sexual assault. The current study examines predictors of college students' intentions to engage in bystander intervention through the theoretical lens of the reasoned action approach. An online survey with college students (N = 186) was conducted at a large Midwestern university. Our results indicated experiential attitudes, instrumental attitudes, descriptive norms, autonomy, and capacity, each positively associated with participants' intentions to intervene to stop a sexual assault. Against expectations, injunctive norms were unrelated to bystander intervention intentions. Finally, in addition to these main effects, an experiential attitude by autonomy interaction was also observed. The results are discussed with a focus on the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

AB Cognitive rehabilitation interventions such as Goal Management Training (GMT) and the Implementation Intentions strategy have been developed with the aim of improving prospective memory (PM) in everyday life. The aim of this study was to provide "proof of concept" for an experimental paradigm that could be used to evaluate the effects of Goal Management Implementation Intentions training (GMTii) derived from the principles of GMT and Implementation Intentions. Thirty adults were randomised to either GMTii or a control training condition. A computerised PM task that involved an ongoing task into which a PM task was embedded was completed pre-training and post-training. In addition, a novel yet similar PM task was completed post-training to assess generalisability of any effect. The two groups had similar overall performance pre-training. Post-training, the GMTii group demonstrated significantly better performance on the familiar computerised PM task showing less performance decay over time compared to the control group. The GMTii group also showed better performance on the novel task. The results demonstrated that brief GMTii significantly improved PM performance compared to control training and that computerised PM tasks were sensitive to this effect. The results suggest that this paradigm could be used to study the effects of metacognitive rehabilitation interventions.

AB Anger outbursts constitute a frequent behavioural issue after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and have a strong negative impact on the social outcomes resulting from the TBI. However, few studies have examined the efficacy of specific intervention strategies to reduce the frequency and intensity of anger outbursts. We therefore performed a single-case study on this topic by administering two successive and complementary psychological interventions with an AB design with maintenance (first intervention) and an AC design with maintenance plus a one-month follow-up (second intervention) to a patient with a severe TBI. Whereas the first intervention focused on improving the recognition and expression of basic emotions, the second consisted of a self-regulation programme, including various features such as psychoeducation about self-control strategies, relaxation and assertiveness training that aimed to establish adequate behaviours, which were further promoted by an implementation intentions strategy in the patient's daily life. The results indicated that all interventions resulted in a reduced frequency and intensity of anger outbursts, and the data upheld the specificity of these effects. In addition, a meta-analytic integration of the effects of both interventions on the outcomes indicated a medium effect size. Further research is needed on other patients who experience long-standing anger outbursts to examine whether the observed gains can be replicated, sustained on a longer-term basis and improved.

AB Objective: The objective was to assess the feasibility of an intervention introducing family planning services screening clinical decision support to improve provision of contraception and/or preconception services for women of reproductive age in our primary care Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) network.
   Study design: We implemented a family planning services screening prompt for support staff to ask women 1344 years at nonobstetric visits at specified time intervals. The response was displayed in the electronic medical record for the provider to review, linked to a documentation tool. We evaluated staff comfort with the screening before and after rollout at all seven FQHC sites. At the pilot site, we examined implementation feasibility by assessing screening rate and the outcome measure of family planning (contraception and/or preconception) documentation during visits by women 13-44 years before and during the intervention's first year.
   Results: At baseline, support staff reported high level of comfort (60% very, 25% somewhat) in asking the family planning services screening question; this increased to 80% reporting they were "very comfortable" in the postsurvey (p = <.01). From mid-December 2016-mid-January 2018, the screening question was displayed for 1503 visits at the pilot site, of which 96% had a documented response. Family planning documentation rate at the pilot site showed a 6% increase from 64% during the preintervention period to 70% during the 13-month intervention period (p<.01). Time series analysis demonstrated more positive upward trend attributed to the intervention period (intervention R-2=0.15 vs. preintervention R-2=0.01).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated high staff acceptability of the intervention at all sites and a high screening rate with a significant increase in family planning documentation rate at the pilot site during the intervention period. This suggests that this family planning services screening decision support intervention is feasible in an FQHC setting.
   Implications: Implementation of a family planning services screening decision support intervention is feasible in an FQHC setting. Further evaluation of performance at multiple sites, accounting for variable site characteristics, is needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Conscientiousness is commonly conceptualized as a personality trait that reflects tendencies to be disciplined, goal oriented, self-controlled, responsible to others, hardworking, orderly, and rule following. Higher levels of conscientiousness reliably predict a host of desirable life outcomes, including longevity and better health throughout the life span. Given the consistently positive relationship of conscientiousness to desirable behaviors and outcomes, there is considerable enthusiasm for researching interventions to improve conscientiousness. The goals of the current review are twofold: (a) to provide an overview of several existing cognitive-behavioral, metacognitive, and cognitive remediation interventions with the potential to influence conscientiousness and (b) to present several suggestions, related to sample selection, intervention components, and sources of support and motivation, for adapting these interventions to promote healthy aging in the general population. As research continues to progress, new psychological interventions may be developed to effectively target conscientiousness and related constructs, ultimately promoting desirable behaviors and outcomes associated with higher levels of this personality trait.

AB Public administrators rely on written communications to send information to citizens and stakeholders, and they are among the heaviest users of the postal service. Behavioral science research has identified several techniques that public administrators can use to increase compliance with written requests and, in turn, increase effectiveness. Currently, however; many written communications from government bodies are not written in a manner that utilizes these techniques. It remains an ongoing challenge for public administrators to identify, understand., and use these techniques in the written communications sent by their organizations. This article presents a framework capturing seven prominent techniques in a simple mnemonic INSPIRE that is already being used by several government bodies in Australia. It also provides practical examples of how to use each technique and demonstrates that using these techniques could result in large aggregate improvements in effectiveness and socially desirable outcomes of public administrators' written communications.

AB Case studies are vehicles to bridge the gap between science and practice because they provide opportunities to blend observations and interventions that have taken place in real-world environments with scientific rigor. The purpose of this invited commentary is to present considerations for those providing applied sport science support to athletes with the intention of broadcasting this information to the scientific community. The authors present a 4-phased approach (1: athlete overview; 2: needs analysis; 3: intervention planning; and 4: results, evaluation, and conclusion) for scientific support to assist practitioners in the development and implementation of scientific support. These considerations are presented in the form of "performance questions" designed to guide and critically evaluate the scientific support process and aid the transfer of this knowledge through case studies.

AB Aim To implement an educational programme for nursing staff on recognising, reporting and managing resident-to-resident elder mistreatment in aged care facilities. Background The phenomenon of a growing ageing population increases the demand of optimum care for older people living in aged care facilities. Caring for older people is complex, but should include the management of aggressive interaction between them. Nursing staff play a vital role in identifying and managing those behaviours. However, many nurses may not recognise these aggressive interactions as abuse. Therefore, this study aims to manage and reduce this abuse through an educational programme. Design Cluster randomised trial registered on the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617001618347). Methods This trial was undertaken in an aged care facility located in Melbourne, Australia and was funded in January 2017. Wards were randomly allocated (as the intervention and control group) by using sealed opaque envelopes. Nursing staff, who met eligibility, were consecutively recruited and supplied their informed consent. Nurses from the intervention group received an educational programme, while nurses from the control group continued with the usual standard care. Main outcomes included recognising, managing and reporting the abuse before and after the intervention and will be evaluated on an intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion It is vital to manage and reduce resident-to-resident elder mistreatment. This educational programme may assist nursing staff to protect vulnerable older people experiencing this abuse and may improve comprehensive evidence-based care for older people residing in aged care facilities.

ID WOUND COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY; REDUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare resources. Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) data identify a higher rate of SSIs for lower extremity bypass than other vascular procedures. Bundled interventions have successfully reduced SSIs in other surgical procedures.
   STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated our institution-specific VQI data for modifiable risk factors associated with index hospitalization SSI from January 2012 through October 2015. We implemented an evidence-based lower extremity bypass operation SSI reduction bundle (ie perioperative chlorhexidine showers and transverse groin incisions) and prospectively enrolled all patients who had lower extremity bypass procedures, with a target adherence rate of 50% per bundle component. Bundle adherence and SSI events were measured from March 2016 through August 2017. We carried out a pre-post evaluation of bundle effectiveness in reducing index hospitalization SSI.
   RESULTS: In the pre-intervention period, 43 of 234 (18%) patients had SSI events. The only risk factors associated with SSI (ie female sex, diabetes, overweight BMI) were not readily modifiable. In an 18-month period after introduction of our intervention, adherence rates to preoperative chlorhexidine showers, a transverse incision, and a postoperative chlorhexidine shower were 71% (52 of 73), 48% (24 of 50), and 88% (64 of 73), respectively. Compliance with all applicable bundle components was 36% (26 of 73). The SSI rate post-intervention decreased from 18% to 4% (3 of 73). Intention-to-treat multivariable analysis showed a 97% SSI risk reduction with the bundle (p = 0.002). As-treated analysis identified 85% (p = 0.02) and 62% (p = 0.047) SSI risk reductions from the preoperative and postoperative chlorhexidine showers, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this evaluation study of the effectiveness of a quality improvement intervention, SSIs were markedly decreased after implementation of our evidence-based bundle for lower extremity vascular bypass procedures.

AB Introduction: Healthier school environments can benefit students, and school wellness policies may result in meaningful enhancements. Schools participating in federal child nutrition programs must implement wellness policies as mandated by law. The primary study objective is to assess effectiveness of implementing school-based nutrition and physical activity policies on student BMI trajectories.
   Study design: Cluster randomized trial using 2 x 2 factorial design.
   Setting/participants: Twelve randomly selected schools in an urban district. Students were followed for 3 years through middle school, fifth to eighth grades (2011-2015, n=595 students, 92.3% participation, 85.2% retention).
   Intervention: Specific to randomized condition, support was provided for implementation of nutrition policies (e.g., alternatives to food-based rewards/celebrations) and physical activity policies (e.g., opportunities for physical activity during/after school).
   Main outcome measures: Sex-/age-adjusted BMI percentile and BMI z-score; behavioral indicators. Data collected via standardized protocols.
   Results: Analyses followed intention-to-treat principles, with planned secondary analyses (conducted 2016-2018). Students at schools randomized to receive support for nutrition policy implementation had healthier BMI trajectories over time (F=3.20, p=0.02), with a greater magnitude over time and cumulatively significant effects 3 years post-intervention (beta=-2.40, p=0.04). Overall, students at schools randomized to receive the nutrition intervention had an increase in BMI percentile of <1%, compared with students in other conditions, whereas BMI percentile increased 3%-4%. There was no difference in student BMI between those in schools with and without physical activity policy implementation. Examining behavioral correlates in eighth grade, students at schools randomized to the nutrition condition consumed fewer unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, and ate less frequently at fast-food restaurants (all p<0.03).
   Conclusions: This cluster randomized trial demonstrated effectiveness of providing support for implementation of school-based nutrition policies, but not physical activity policies, to limit BMI increases among middle school students. Results can guide future school interventions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Bad policy design affects public service delivery and the conditions for providing public services at operational level. Fragmentation of public management due to governance reforms becomes visible in policy failure; a problem for governments, public service providers, and citizens. The poor outcome of a reformed regional museum education policy is the starting point for a study of paradoxes of regional cultural policy implementation. The article opens up the black box of policy implementation and identifies goal conflicts in regional development policy, conflicting expectations among stakeholders, as well as governance paradoxes resulting in gaps between policy intentions, output, and outcome.

AB Research has found that implementation intentions, if-then action plans (e.g., "if I see a Black face, I will think safe"), reduce stereotyping on implicit measures. However, it is unknown by what process(es) implementation intentions reduce implicit stereotyping. The present research examines the effects of implementation intentions on stereotype activation (e.g., extent to which stereotypic information is accessible) and stereotype application (e.g., extent to which accessible stereotypes are applied in judgment). In addition, we assessed the efficiency of implementation intentions by manipulating cognitive resources (e.g., digit-span, restricted response window) while participants made judgments on an implicit stereotyping measure. Across four studies, implementation intentions reduced implicit stereotyping. This decrease in stereotyping was associated with reductions in both stereotype activation and application. In addition, these effects of implementation intentions were highly efficient and associated with reduced stereotyping even for groups for which people may have little practice inhibiting stereotypes (e.g., gender).

AB Background Child stunting reduces survival and impairs neurodevelopment. We tested the independent and combined effects of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) on stunting and anaemia in in Zimbabwe.
   Methods We did a cluster-randomised, community-based, 2 x 2 factorial trial in two rural districts in Zimbabwe. Clusters were defined as the catchment area of between one and four village health workers employed by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care. Women were eligible for inclusion if they permanently lived in clusters and were confirmed pregnant. Clusters were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1: 1) to standard of care (52 clusters), IYCF (20 g of a small-quantity lipidbased nutrient supplement per day from age 6 to 18 months plus complementary feeding counselling; 53 clusters), WASH (construction of a ventilated improved pit latrine, provision of two handwashing stations, liquid soap, chlorine, and play space plus hygiene counselling; 53 clusters), or IYCF plus WASH (53 clusters). A constrained randomisation technique was used to achieve balance across the groups for 14 variables related to geography, demography, water access, and community-level sanitation coverage. Masking of participants and fieldworkers was not possible. The primary outcomes were infant length-for-age Z score and haemoglobin concentrations at 18 months of age among children born to mothers who were HIV negative during pregnancy. These outcomes were analysed in the intention-totreat population. We estimated the effects of the interventions by comparing the two IYCF groups with the two nonIYCF groups and the two WASH groups with the two non-WASH groups, except for outcomes that had an important statistical interaction between the interventions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01824940.
   Findings Between Nov 22, 2012, and March 27, 2015, 5280 pregnant women were enrolled from 211 clusters. 3686 children born to HIV-negative mothers were assessed at age 18 months (884 in the standard of care group from 52 clusters, 893 in the IYCF group from 53 clusters, 918 in the WASH group from 53 clusters, and 991 in the IYCF plus WASH group from 51 clusters). In the IYCF intervention groups, the mean length-for-age Z score was 0.16 (95% CI 0.08-0.23) higher and the mean haemoglobin concentration was 2.03 g/L (1.28-2.79) higher than those in the non-IYCF intervention groups. The IYCF intervention reduced the number of stunted children from 620 (35%) of 1792 to 514 (27%) of 1879, and the number of children with anaemia from 245 (13.9%) of 1759 to 193 (10.5%) of 1845. The WASH intervention had no effect on either primary outcome. Neither intervention reduced the prevalence of diarrhoea at 12 or 18 months. No trial-related serious adverse events, and only three trial-related adverse events, were reported.
   Interpretation Household-level elementary WASH interventions implemented in rural areas in low-income countries are unlikely to reduce stunting or anaemia and might not reduce diarrhoea. Implementation of these WASH interventions in combination with IYCF interventions is unlikely to reduce stunting or anaemia more than implementation of IYCF alone. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

AB The primary objective of this study is to develop the pioneering version of Krueger's (2009) integrated model of entrepreneurial intention (EI) and to empirically test the new model in explaining individuals' intentions of entrepreneurial activities. The data were collected by the self-reported in-person and electronic questionnaires from a population of tourism students from several universities in Iran. The results of partial least squares estimations indicate that desirability is the main determinant of entrepreneurial goal intention (EGI), followed by self-efficacy, feasibility, opportunity, attitude, and collective-efficacy, while social norms do not influence EGI. Also, EGI strongly influences entrepreneurial implementation intention. Concerning the modification effect, the impact of perceived opportunity on EGI tends to increase when an individual has a high propensity to act. The findings provide policy makers with important insights into how to nurture tourism students' EIs through educational programs.

ID ADOPTION
AB Objective: Evaluate an electronic health record (EHR) implementation across a large public health department to better understand and improve implementation effectiveness of EHRs in public health departments.
   Design: A survey based on Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs was administered to staff before and after implementation of an EHR.
   Setting: Large suburban county department of health and human services that provides clinical, behavioral, social, and oral health services.
   Participants: Staff across 4 program areas completed the survey prior to EHR implementation (n = 331, June 2014) and 3 months post-EHR final implementation (n = 229, December 2015).
   Intervention: Electronic health record
   Main OutcomeMeasures: Constructswere validated using confirmatory factor analysis and included information strengths and information gaps in the current environment; EHR impacts; ease of use; future use intentions; usefulness; knowledge of system; and training. Paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests of a matched sample were performed to compare the pre-/postrespondent scores.
   Results: A majority of user perceptions and expectations showed a significant (P <.05) decline 3 months postimplementation as compared with the baseline with variation by service area and construct. Staff perceived the EHR to be less useful and more complex, provide fewer benefits, and reduce information access shortly after implementation.
   Conclusions: Electronic health records can benefit public health practices in many ways; however, public health departments will face significant challenges incorporating EHRs, which are typically designed for non-public health settings, into the public healthworkflow. Electronic health record implementation recommendations for health departments are provided. When implementing an EHR in a public health setting, health departments should provide extensive preimplementation training opportunities, including EHR training tailored to job roles, competencies, and tasks; assess usability and specific capabilities at a more granular level as part of procurement processes and consider using contracting language to facilitate usability, patient safety, and related evaluations to enhance effectiveness and efficiencies and make results public; apply standard terminologies, processes, and data structures across different health department service areas using common public health terminologies; and craft workforce communication campaigns that balance potential expected benefits with realistic expectations.

AB Background: Previous research suggests that smoking cessation interventions are poorly implemented. This study reports the development and testing of a questionnaire including knowledge, attitude, behavioral, and organizational (KABO) factors affecting the implementation of smoking cessation practices in hospitals by health care providers and organizations.
   Methods: An initial pool of 44 items was developed to assess the individual knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of health professionals towards smoking cessation practices according to the 5 A's intervention model, as well as organizational barriers and opportunities for its implementation. Items were measured in a scale from 0 = "Not at all/Never" to 10 = "Completely/Always". Data were collected from health workers (n = 702) in Catalonia. The validity of the instrument was measured by: (a) analyzing the items, (b) assessing the internal structure, (c) estimating the internal consistency, and (d) analyzing the relationship between this tool and the 5 As intervention model.
   Results: Seven domains were extracted: individual skills, positive organizational support, attitudes and beliefs, individual commitment, organizational resources, beliefs about patient desire/readiness to quit, and organizational endorsement. These domains explained 69.7% of the variance, and allowed for the development of a refined 26-item version of the questionnaire. Both the seven domains and the total scale showed adequate internal consistency.
   Conclusions: Psychometric testing indicates that the KABO questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the main barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation intervention implementation. Individual factors better explained the implementation of smoking cessation interventions in hospitals, and the seven identified domains can be used for further investigations into how the implementation of evidence-based practices impacts smoking cessation performance.

AB BackgroundMusculoskeletal problems substantially impact the demand for and the finances of the United Kingdom's National Health Service. Some of this demand and cost could be alleviated if patients use self-directed-exercises. The present study aims first to establish whether general practitioners already recommend self-directed-exercises and second to describe barriers and facilitators to making such recommendations.MethodThe design of the current study included surveys and interviews. The surveys were designed to draw out participants' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises and their behavioral drivers to do so. The drivers investigated include 14 domains described by the Theoretical Domains Framework. The surveys were completed online and the responses were analyzed using descriptive reports and regression analyses. The interviews were designed to more fully understand participants' experiences recommending self-directed-exercises according to the same framework. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.ResultsThe survey found that the following domains significantly predicted participants' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises: Environmental contexts and resources, Goals, Intentions, Knowledge, Memory attention and decision processes, and Social/professional role. The interviews brought out four themes that could be leveraged to increase general practitioners' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises: (1) Practitioners' beliefs about self-directed-exercises being effective, (2) Patients' motivations to engage in self-directed-exercises, (3) Time constraints, and (4) The ease with which practitioners can recommend self-directed-exercises.ConclusionsMost general practitioners already recommend self-directed-exercises, though they note significant barriers that may prevent them from doing so. General practitioners' tendency to recommend self-directed-exercises would be bolstered by creating a respected central resource of exercise pamphlets. These pamphlets should clearly describe how different self-directed-exercises should be performed and evidence supporting their effectiveness.

AB Background: Construction work frequently involves heavy physical work, and a reduction of the physical workload should have high priority. Technological development has made it possible to obtain field measurements with surface electromyography (sEMG), kinematics measured with inertial measurement units (IMUs), and video recordings. However, no studies have used these methods simultaneously to detect situations with excessive physical workload (events) during a working day. Thus, knowledge about these specific events may combat work-related risk factors. Participatory ergonomics (PE) has shown promising results, but whether it can be used as a tool to reduce the physical workload during construction work remains unknown.
   Objective: This cluster randomized controlled trial investigated whether a PE intervention with technical measurements consisting of IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings of physical workload could reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during a working day. Furthermore, other outcomes were obtained from questionnaires.
   Methods: A total of 80 male full-time construction workers (aged 19 to 67 years) were randomized at the cluster level (gang) to a PE intervention consisting of 3 workshops (7 gangs and 32 workers) or to a control group (8 gangs and 48 workers). The physical workload was recorded by technical measurements, that is, IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings during a full working day at baseline and 3 and 6 months' follow-up. On the basis of the technical measurements, a custom-made computer program detected the situations (events) where the construction workers were exposed to excessive physical workload and used in the intervention. Differences in the number of events from baseline to follow-up between intervention and control were evaluated using linear mixed models (intention-to-treat), with individual nested in cluster as a random factor. Furthermore, questionnaires were filled out on test days.
   Results: The results of the primary outcome showed no change in the number of events with excessive physical workload. However, compared with the control group, the other outcomes showed decreased general fatigue after a typical working day (P=. 001) and increased influence on own work (P=. 04).
   Conclusions: This PE intervention with technical measurements did not reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during construction work. However, the intervention led to decreased general fatigue and increased influence on own work.

AB BackgroundWe evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a loyalty scheme based intervention involving rewards for increasing physical activity in public sector employees.MethodsA cluster randomised wait-list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18-65years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376.ResultsBetween September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation=four) and 853 participants to the intervention (n=19 with 457 participants) or control group (n=18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (544%) intervention and 236 (596%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference=-336, 95% CI: -612 to -60, p=002) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 297h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p=062), which could result in net savings ranging from 66 to 735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants.Conclusions p id=Par4 Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.Trial registration p id= Par5 ISRCTN17975376 (Registered 19/09/2014).

AB This article addresses two influential lines of argument for what might be termed "scientific epiphenomenalism" about conscious intentions - the thesis that neither conscious intentions nor their physical correlates are among the causes of bodily motions - and links this thesis to skepticism about free will and moral responsibility. One line of argument is based on Benjamin Libet's neuroscientific work on free will. The other is based on a mixed bag of findings presented by social psychologist Daniel Wegner. It is argued that both lines of argument are unsuccessful.

AB Background
   Exposure to violence has negative consequences on mental health. Armed-conflict in Colombia has widely affected Afro-descendants in the Pacific region. Evidence regarding effectiveness of mental health interventions is lacking in low-income settings, especially in areas with active conflict. The objective of this study is to evaluate an individualized Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), a transdiagnostic psychotherapy model based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, for adult trauma survivors.
   Methods and findings
   A referred sample of 521 adult Afro-descendants from Buenaventura and Quibdo, Colombia, experiencing significant sadness, suffering or fear (score>0.77 in Total Mental Health Symptoms), with history of traumatic experiences, and with associated functional impairment were randomly allocated to CETA intervention, standby group without intervention, but under monthly monitoring, or a Narrative Community-Based Group Therapy. CETA was provided by trained Lay Psychosocial Community Workers without previous mental health experience, supervised by psychologists, during 12-14 weekly, 1.5-hour sessions. Symptoms were assessed with a locally validated survey built based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the PTSD CheckList-Civilian Version, a qualitative study for additional general symptoms and a gender-specific functional impairment scale. CETA was compared with the control group and the intervention effects were calculated with mixed models using intention to treat analysis. Participant completion of follow-up was 75.1% and 13.2% voluntarily withdrew. Reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms was significant in both municipalities when comparing intervention and control groups (mean difference), with a with a moderate effect size in Buenaventura (Cohen's d = 0.70) and a small effect size in Quibdo (d = 0.31). In Buenaventura, the intervention also had significant effects on depression (large effect size d = 1.03), anxiety (large effect size d = 0.80) and functional impairment (moderate effect size d = 0.70). In Quibdo, it had no significant effect on these outcomes. Changes in Total Mental Health Symptoms were not significant in neither city.
   Conclusions
   This trial suggests that CETA, can be effective in improving depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and function among victims of systematized violence in low-income and active conflict settings. Nonetheless, the difference of effectiveness between the two cities of intervention may indicate that we cannot assume that a mental health intervention known to be effective in one setting will be effective in another, even in similar circumstances and population. This may have special importance when implementing and reproducing these types of intervention in non-controlled circumstances. Further research should address these concerns. Results can be of use by governmental decision-makers when defining mental health programs for survivors.

AB While the fact that the implementation of migration policies fails to perfectly manage migration is well known, the actual dynamics of policy implementation have received little attention to date. A serious engagement with this phenomenon requires a move beyond policy texts and political intentions, and towards a 'migration regime' perspective that pays attention to the inherent contradictions, conflicts of interest and competing logics within migration control practices. This collection posits a multi-actor perspective that includes state agents, migrants and non-state actors alike and proposes three key factors that require a closer examination: competing institutional logics, discretionary practices and migrants' agency. Based on original empirical research, the contributions of this collection 'zoom in' on specific asymmetrical negotiations over the right to enter or remain in Europe, and focus on the institutional logics and interplay between the different actors involved.

AB The implementation of mandatory energy-efficiency on electronic products is one of the strategies used by governments to mitigate the environmental impact of consumption. Yet, studies on mandatory energy-efficiency labels and the pivotal role of consumers' attention to such labels remain limited. Thus, this study examines the key drivers of consumers' attention to energy-efficiency labels that must by law be affixed to all home appliances sold in South Africa. Based on the signalling theory and the attitude-to-behaviour theory, an integrated model was designed to explore these drivers. Using the data from a survey involving 440 South African home appliance users, the model was tested through the structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. The empirical results indicated that consumers pay attention to energy-efficiency labels when they trust the energy-efficiency credentials of products, and when they intend to purchase energy-efficient appliances. Perceived product price was established as an important marketing signal for improving consumer trust in energy-efficiency labels, while social norms and attitude were confirmed as the most important antecedents of the consumer purchase intention of energy-efficient appliances. The findings provide important insights useful for the development of policy interventions aimed at promoting the use of more environmentally friendly home appliances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MEDICINES
AB The drive for improved regulatory systems and the establishment of a more effective regulatory framework in South Africa has been evident for the past two decades but despite political intentions and legislative revisions success has been limited to date. Efforts to address the increasing volume of applications that have been received have to date failed and resources have been stretched to capacity resulting in the development of a significant backlog and extended timelines for product registration. The promulgation of the recently amended Medicines and Related Substance Act of 1965 triggered the establishment of the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) as a separate juristic person outside of the National Department of Health to replace the former medicine regulatory authority the Medicines Control Council (MCC). The aim of this review is to provide the historical context supporting the new regulatory environment in South Africa and the transition from the MCC to SAHPRA. Key recommendations to SAHPRA to ensure the full potential of the new regulatory environment in South Africa include: establishing a quality management system to safeguard accountability, consistency and transparency and to streamline the implementation of good review practices including quality decision-making practices and benefit-risk assessment; the measurement and monitoring of regulatory performance, targets for overall approval time and key review milestones to instill a culture of accurate metrics collection and measurement of key performance indicators and their continuous improvement and the employment of a risk-based approach to the evaluation of medical products and codify the use of facilitated regulatory pathways in policy and culture. The application of a risk-based approach to regulatory review commensurate with a product's risk to patients will facilitate the application of increased resources for pharmacovigilance activities and to support the reliance and recognition of reference agencies.

AB The over-exploitation of natural capital and unsustainable production practices has contributed to increased pollution, biodiversity loss, drought, and deforestation. The food and beverage (F&B) sector is one of the largest contributors to the Indonesian economy but it is also responsible for various environmental impacts. Implementing Environmental Management Systems (EMS) is one way to promote improved sustainable practices within organisations, particularly those within the F&B sector. This research investigates the drivers, barriers and incentives for implementing EMS and their causal relationships. Data were collected from 59 F&B companies in East Java, Indonesia. The results indicate that the implementation of EMS tends to be driven internally in an effort to enhance market competitiveness. There is a need for institutions to exert pressures to develop organizational capability to implement EMS. External barriers are significant impeding factors, while internal barriers do not have a direct link to EMS implementation. The moderating role of technical incentives underlines the need to improve infrastructure and policy to support EMS implementation. Theoretical and practical insights for governments and industries are also discussed.

ID MODEL
AB Health literacy is a driver of community empowerment and a key determinant of health and equity. The World Health Organisation has established a strong global mandate for addressing health literacy through public policy action, by positioning it as one of three key pillars for achieving sustainable development and health equity in the Shanghai Declaration on Health Promotion. Policy document analysis is a useful way of determining the strengths and limitations of past and current policies, as well as the likely success of their implementation and impact on health outcomes. In this study, we developed a framework for analysing policy documents to assess the extent to which they prioritise and operationalise an emergent public health issue, in this case health literacy. Specifically, the framework enables a systematic exploration of (i) the stated policy goals and strategic objectives; (ii) the stated policy actions; and (iii) whether there is an intention to resource and monitor the stated policy activities. We tested the utility of the framework by applying it to a set of public policies in the Australian context. The framework presented in this study may be a useful tool for systematically analysing policy documents to reveal their strengths and limitations, and the extent to which they prioritise and operationalise health literacy.

AB End-tidal CO2 (etCO(2)) monitoring is not a new modality in the pediatric emergency department (PED) and emergency department. It is the standard of care during certain procedures such as intubations and sedations and can be used in variety of clinical situations. However, etCO(2) may be underused in the PED setting. The implementation of etCO(2) monitoring may be accomplished many ways, but a foundation of capnography principles specifically in ventilation, cardiac output, and current literature regarding its application is essential to successful implementation. It is the intention of this article to briefly review the principles of etCO(2) monitoring and its clinical applications in the PED setting.

AB In this article, we propose several improvements that could be done to SPICE simulator. The first is based on a functional implementation of device models. The advantages of functional implementation are demonstrated on basic Shichman-Hodges model of MOS transistor. It starts with a description of primary algorithms used in SPICE simulator for the solution of circuits with nonlinear devices and identify the problems that can occur during simulations. Main part of the article is devoted to improved factorization procedure for simulation of the nonlinear electronic circuits. The primary intention of the proposed method is to increase final precision of the result in a case of high condition linear systems. The procedure is based on a use of the iterative methods for solution of nonlinear and linear equations. Utilizing those methods for one iterative process helps to reduce memory consumption during simulation computation, and it can significantly improve simulation precision. The procedure allows to use enumeration with definable precision in a very efficient way.

AB Background: We implemented a multidisciplinary pre-and rehabilitation program for elderly patients (>= 75 years of age) in a single center consisting of prehabilitation, laparoscopic surgery and early rehabilitation with the intention to lower 1-year overall mortality.
   Methods: In this study we compared all patients that underwent elective surgery for stage I-III colorectal cancer before and during development and after implementation of the program (2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2014-2015). Primary endpoint was 1-year overall mortality, the secondary endpoint was 30 day postoperative outcome.
   Results: Eighty-six consecutive patients were included in the study cohort and compared to 63 patients from 2010 to 2011 and 75 patients from 2012 to 2013. Patient characteristics were comparable; median age in the study cohort was 80.6. Seventy-three patients (85%) participated in the program, 54 (63%) of whom followed a prehabilitation program, 46 (53%) of whom were discharged to a rehabilitation center. Laparoscopic surgery increased over the years from 70% to 83% in the study cohort. There was a trend in lower 1-year overall mortality: 11% versus 3% (p=0.08). There was a significant reduction in cardiac complications and the number of patients with a prolonged length of stay (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Multidisciplinary care for elderly colorectal cancer patients that includes prehabilitation and rehabilitation is feasible and may contribute to lower complications and reduced length of stay. This study did not show a clear benefit of implementing a comprehensive care program including both prehabilitation and rehabilitation. Dedicated multidisciplinary care seems the key attributer to favorable outcomes of CRC surgery in elderly patients.

AB This study examined help-seeking behavior from professional, informal, and religious sources in veterans with a probable need for treatment. In total, 93 veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder/major depressive disorder completed assessments of help-seeking at two time points spaced apart by 6 months. Less than half (40%) reached out to a mental health professional or physician; only 1 in 10 engaged with providers who specialize in evidence-based therapies to a minimally adequate degree. Although roughly two thirds pursued help from informal sources, less than 10% similarly sought help nine or more times. Veterans with high willingness to seek help from specific sources at baseline were more likely to report sustained engagement in help-seeking behavior along these same lines at follow-up. Assessing veterans' help-seeking intentions may add prognostic value in predicting engagement in services. Veterans may also benefit from tailoring service delivery models according to preferred sources of help in their families and communities.

AB Aim: The aim of this research was to evaluate CAN-Implement. Pro as a structured and systematic process for planning local evidence implementation, to develop a contextual and demographic profile of potential users and assess their initial perceptions and intention to use CAN-Implement. Pro.
   Methods: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval number: H-2016-157). A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken to capture the demographic characteristics of participants, as well as their initial perceptions of, and intention to use, the software for guideline adaptation projects.
   Results: A total of 21 individuals representing guideline groups completed the survey. Only 43% had taken part in at least one previous implementation project. Thirty-three percent reported embarking on their first implementation project; 24% had yet to participate in an evidence implementation project. Nursing was the most highly referenced profession at 75%, followed by medical specialties (40%); two respondents indicated allied health professions were included in their implementation group. Respondents represented countries or regions of high and upper middle income as classified by the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. The majority (67%) found CAN-Implement. Pro to be well-organized, easy to navigate and reliable. Most (80%) also indicated they were more likely to return to the software than not; 20% were neutral. In terms of overall satisfaction, more than half (60%) were very satisfied or satisfied, a third (33%) was neutral and 7% were dissatisfied. Over 66% of the respondents considered their group to be familiar with the knowledge-to-action model. A slightly higher percentage (74%) reported software based upon the knowledge-to-action model had a strong conceptual framework. In terms of evidence informed functionality, 75% of the respondents concluded that the software could assist guideline groups to provide structure for their implementation planning; a similar proportion (75%) indicated that the software would also enhance or improve coordination, communication and logistics management in guideline-related implementation projects. Participants were familiar with a range of resources, models, theories and frameworks for implementation, implementation planning and guideline adaptation. The most common frameworks were related to behavioural theories or variations of the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework.
   Conclusion: Eighty percent of the respondents indicated that their group would be likely to use the software to guide implementation planning in future projects, whereas 20% were neutral. In terms of expectations for contemporary software, multimedia resources rated highly, as did interactive components within the knowledge-to-action model.

AB Objectives: To realize safe, high-quality treatment, employees should behave according to patient safety standards. Periodic measurement of safety behavior could provide management-relevant information to adjust the implementation of interventions and maximize improvement. Therefore, we constructed a factorial survey measuring safety awareness and intentions for behavior.
   Methods: Cross-sectional results of the factorial survey were compared with results from the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture, distributed in MAASTRO radiotherapy in 2010 to 2011. Respondents were presented 20 scenarios about incidents, randomly varying on work pressure, person causing incident, whether patient level was reached, severity of harm, notification by patient, and management support. After each scenario, questions were asked about safety awareness and behavior. w 2 and multilevel regression analyses were used.
   Results: Response rates were 64% (n = 54) for the culture survey and 62% (n = 52) for the factorial survey on intentions. The culture survey reflected positive opinions regarding nonpunitive response and incident reporting, in accordance with high scores (factorial survey) on safety awareness (9.0; scale, 1-10) and reporting intentions (8.7). Whether an incident reached the patient level predicted safety awareness and intentions for safety behavior (beta = -1.3/-3.08) most strongly. Severity of harm showed minimal additional effects (beta = -0.24/-0.42).
   Conclusions: The factorial survey presented practical information on safety awareness and intentions for behavior. Therefore, it created additional opportunities for improving safety interventions. Because behavior is expected to change before values, one could hypothesize that factorial surveys would be more sensitive to change than culture surveys. Longitudinal research should further study the surveys' sensitivity tomeasure changes.

AB Questions Current studies on breastfeeding behavior that adequately consider migration aspects are not available from Germany. The following research questions should be answered with the help of a prospective study: What factors influence the probability of (premature) weaning and actual breastfeeding duration? What roles do migration background (MB) and generation play? Do observed effects persist after controlling for education, parity, etc.?
   Patient cohort and methodology In a one-year study in 3 Berlin maternity hospitals, women were interviewed on sociodemografic details and migration aspects on admission to the delivery room. On the 2nd/3rd day postpartum, another standardized interview was conducted that included questions on the beginning of breastfeeding and planned breastfeeding period. Six months postpartum, a sub-cohort was interviewed by telephone or other means about the actual breastfeeding period. Nursing behavior was analyzed using multivariate regression models. A Cox regression was used to analyze actual breastfeeding duration and possible influencing factors.
   Results The pre-partum group included 7,100 women (57.9 % with a migrant background), 6,884 women were interviewed on the maternity ward, and 605 women were in the sub-cohort questioned six months postpartum. 55.9 % of first-generation migrant women, 32.9 % of 2nd/3rd-generation migrant women, and 52.9 % of women with no MB were still breastfeeding 6 months postpartum (p < 0.001). In the adjusted regression model, women with a migrant background were more likely to start breastfeeding than women with no MB. Cox's regression analysis examined the likelihood of breastfeeding within 6 months: The adjusted model showed no effect of migration status.
   Conclusion The migration background factor has only a small influence on breastfeeding behavior. Possible differences should take the migration generation into account.

AB Background. Rates of tobacco treatment delivery in primary care are suboptimal. Aims. We report on the effectiveness of the TiTAN Crete intervention on rates of patient-reported 4As (ask, advise, assist, arrange) tobacco treatment and general practitioner's (GP) knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions. Methods. A quasi-experimental pilot study with pre-post evaluation was conducted in Crete, Greece (2015-2016). GPs (n = 24) intervention and control group and a cross-sectional sample of their patients (n = 841) were surveyed before the implementation of the intervention. GPs in the intervention group received training, practice, and patient tools to support the integration of the 4As treatment into clinical routines. Intervention group GPs (n = 14) and a second cross-sectional sample of patients (n = 460) were surveyed 4 months following the intervention to assess changes in outcomes of interest. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze data. Results. Among GPs exposed to the intervention, significant increases in knowledge, self-efficacy, and rates of 4As delivery were documented between the pre- and postassessment and compared with those of the control group. Specifically, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 4As delivery between the pre-and postassessment among GPs exposed to the TiTAN intervention were as follows: Ask AOR 3.66 (95% CI [2.61, 5.14]); Advise AOR 4.21 (95% CI [3.02, 5.87]); Assist AOR 13.10 (95% CI [8.83, 19.42]) and Arrange AOR 4.75 (95% CI [2.67, 8.45]). Conclusion. We found significant increases in rates at which GPs delivered evidence-based tobacco treatment following exposure to the TiTAN intervention. Future research should examine methods for supporting broader dissemination of well-designed training interventions in general practice.

AB Objective. To describe the design of, and participant-level outcomes related to, a religiously tailored, peer-led group education program aimed at enhancing Muslim women's mammography intention. Method. Using a community-engaged approach and mixed methods, we identified and addressed barrier beliefs impeding mammography screening among Muslim American women. Our religiously tailored, mosque-based, peer-led intervention involved facilitated discussions and expert-led didactics conveying health-related religious teachings, and information about the benefits and process of mammography. Barrier beliefs were addressed through reframing, reprioritizing, or reforming such beliefs. Participant surveys were collected preintervention, postintervention, 6 months postintervention, and 1 year postintervention. These measured changes in mammography intention, likelihood, confidence, and resonance with barrier and facilitator beliefs. Results. A total of 58 Muslim women (mean age = 50 years) that had not had a mammogram in the past 2 years participated in the two-session program. Self-reported likelihood of obtaining a mammogram increased significantly (p = .01) and coincided with a positive trend in confidence (p = .08). Individuals with higher agreement with barrier beliefs preintervention had lower odds for positive change in likelihood (odds ratio = 0.80, p = .03), while those who were married had higher odds for positive change in likelihood (odds ratio = 37.69, p = .02). At 1-year follow-up, 22 participants had obtained a mammogram. Conclusion. Our pilot mosque-based intervention demonstrated efficacy in improving Muslim women's self-reported likelihood of obtaining mammograms, and increased their mammography utilization, with nearly 40% obtaining a mammogram within 12 months of the intervention. Impact. Our conceptual model for religiously tailoring messages, along with its implementation curriculum, proved effective in enhancing the likelihood and receipt of mammograms among Muslim American women. Accordingly, our work advances both the theory and practice of faith-based interventions and provides a model for addressing Muslim women's cancer screening disparities.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an innovation that is transforming practices within the Architectural, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sectors. Many studies have investigated the process of BIM adoption and diffusion and in particular, the drivers affecting adoption at different levels, ranging from individual and team through organisations and supply chains to whole market level. However, in-depth investigations of the stages of the BIM adoption process and the drivers, factors and determinants affecting such stages are still lacking. A comprehensive classification and integration of adoption drivers and factors is absent as these are disjointedly identified across disparate studies. There is also limited attention to the key terms and concepts (i.e. readiness, implementation, diffusion, adoption) in this area of study.
   This aim in this paper is twofold: (1) to develop and validate a Unified BIM Adoption Taxonomy (UBAT); and (2) to identify the taxonomy's constructs (i.e. three driver clusters and their 17 factors) that have influence on the first three stages of the BIM adoption process namely, awareness, interest, and decision stages, and compare their effects on each of the stages. The research uses: a systematic literature review and knowledge synthesisation to develop the taxonomy; a confirmatory factor analysis for its validation; and an ordinal logistic regression to test the effect of the UBAT's constructs on the BIM adoption process within the UK Architectural sector using a sample of 177 organisations.
   The paper is primarily intended to enhance the reader's understanding of the BIM adoption process and the constructs that influence its stages. The taxonomy and its sets of drivers and determinants can be used to perform various analyses of the BIM adoption process, delivering evidence and insights for decision makers within organisations and across whole market when formulating BIM diffusion strategies.

AB This study examines the intention of environmentally-oriented social enterprises to continue using Green IS (an eco-localization website here) in Herefordshire located in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom. The Herefordshire Greenlinks (HGL) Association is a local business community that operates primarily through the HGL Website in order to help local social enterprises find and trade local eco-friendly goods and services. It is an example of a "market-based" approach to solving social and environmental issues that is inspired by a bottom-up view of community development and eco-localization. Based on the theory of uses and gratification of media use and the new environmental paradigm, we propose a research model that outlines the various factors contributing to intention to continue using an eco-localization website. The research model and its associated hypotheses were empirically tested using a dataset generated from a survey of 83 small social enterprises. The results demonstrate the importance of three different types of gratification - content, social and performance gratification as well as users' environmental concerns in determining the intention to continue using an eco-localization website. This study contributes to the Green IS literature by extending research to the social sector environment, and it also provides practical insight for designers of such community-led eco-localization websites.

AB Objective: A substantial proportion of psychotherapeutic treatments are prematurely terminated because the client discontinues attendance. Interventions have been developed to reduce premature termination, but these are only moderately effective and often place considerable burden on clients and services. This research evaluated a brief, low-cost self-regulation intervention (i.e., implementation intentions) designed to sustain attendance at a group psychoeducation program. Method: Clients (N = 82) who had been referred for a psychological intervention due to anxiety or depression were sent a questionnaire concerning their views of attendance. Participants were randomly assigned to form an implementation intention as part of the questionnaire or not (controls). Attendance was then monitored over the 5 scheduled sessions of an evidence-based psychoeducational intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that forming implementation intentions led to attendance at a greater number of sessions (M = 2.84 vs. 1.62), p < .01, and higher rates of completing the full course of treatment compared to controls (35% vs. 11%), p < .02. Conclusions: An intervention rooted in basic research on the psychology of action increased and sustained attendance at a mental health service.

AB Background Teledermatology (TD) provides efficient care for skin cancer patients. Objective Methods To compare the clinical effectiveness of imiquimod 5% for the treatment of AK with in-person care and through TD. Longitudinal prospective controlled study including patients with single AK diagnosed and treated at face-to-face visits (FTF group) or through teledermatology (TD group) with imiquimod 5% cream. The main outcome measures assessed were the complete and global response percentage (CR and GR) under per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Results Conclusions A total of 157 patients were enrolled (FTF = 75, TD = 82). PP analysis showed CR in 66.7% of FTF patients and 65.6% in TD patients (P > 0.05). The ITT yielded CR in 64.0% and 51.2% in FTF visits and TD, respectively (P = 0.073). The analysis showed an advantage of FTF care against TD in achieving GR (84.0% vs. 70.7%; P = 0.036). Facial location and local adverse reactions were the only explanatory factors of complete response in the ITT approach. Treatment completion was found in 90.7% and 72.0% in the FTF and TD groups, respectively (P = 0.004). Improvements in patient counselling at the primary care centre are needed before the implementation of TD as a routine methodology for the management of AK.

AB Objectives: To refine the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s contraceptive education poster using patient-centered design.
   Study design: We conducted cognitive interviews with 26 women aged 18-44 living in North Carolina who spoke and read English and had ever had sex. We interviewed women about both a CDC and a patient-centered poster in alternating order. Participants were contraceptive users and non-users that we selected purposively to have a range of characteristics that might influence their perspective: age, race/ethnicity, previous births and pregnancies, contraceptive method(s) used in the past three months, pregnancy intentions, and numeracy. The initial response rate for participants was 55%. We used cognitive theory to code interviews for comprehension, relevance, and acceptability, as well as design and overall preference. We structured the 26 interviews into four rounds and revised the patient-centered poster after each round to improve these measures.
   Results: By the final round, 83% of women preferred the patient-centered poster. The majority of women favored this poster's relevance (86%), and design (100%) and ease of comprehension (86%). Women raised few concerns about the acceptability of the final version of the patient-centered poster. Women identified many issues with both posters that the researchers did not anticipate, highlighting the value of patient-centered design approaches to educational materials.
   Conclusions: This study refined a patient-centered poster so that its language is clear and it addresses the informational needs of its target audience. Implications: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs recommend that clinicians educate women about contraception. This study developed a poster that could help clinicians follow this recommendation. Before widespread implementation, more research is needed to evaluate the poster's impact on contraceptive knowledge and behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Despite the beneficial impact of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for older patients in the hospital, it is not clear to what extent these models have been implemented in European hospitals. This study aims to map the implementation status of CGA-based models of care in general hospitals in Europe.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in autumn 2017 to map the implementation status of CGA-based care models in general hospitals (n = 178) in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, and Slovenia.
   Results Acute geriatric units are implemented in all of the Belgian and the majority of Danish hospitals, but are scarce in Malta, Estonia, Slovenia and Greece. Geriatric rehabilitation units are most common in Ireland (63.6%) and Iceland (75%). In-hospital multidisciplinary geriatric consultation teams are widely implemented in Belgium (100%), Ireland (72.7%) and Denmark (59.1%), but are rare in Malta, Iceland, Estonia and Greece. Transitional care programs to ensure continuity of care after discharge are present in 60.1% of all hospitals. The intention to implement any of these care models in the next 5 years ranges from 10.3 to 25.4% and is the highest for co-management (36.5%), systematic screening of ED patients (36.2%) and transitional care programs (29.6%).
   Conclusions A great variety in the implementation of CGA-based care models was observed among the surveyed EU countries with the uptake being the highest in Belgium, Denmark and Ireland. A supportive legislative framework and a residency training in geriatrics favor the implementation of the geriatric care models.

ID SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKING; OPENFLOW
AB Scalable network-wide traffic classification (TC), combined with knowledge of endpoint identities, will enable the next wave of innovation in networking, by exposing a valuable layer of TC-enriched flow context information for applications to consume. However, full TC services over standard software-defined networking (SDN) architecture, where packets requiring application services must pass via the control plane, do not scale. Sending packets that require TC inspection to a TC application via the control plane causes resource exhaustion on the control plane (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and this in turn severely degrades network performance, thus limiting the scalability of such an approach. In this paper, we demonstrate that full TC in SDN can be designed to scale. We describe our scalable TC architecture built atop of widely available OpenFlow v1.3, using a system-based approach. We demonstrate improvements to performance and scalability of SDN TC through experimental results from our prototype implementation. Our intention with this work is to run higher complexity classification functions and demonstrate how this approach benefits TC use cases, as well as SDN standardization.

AB Prior studies find sizable gaps between entrepreneurial intentions and subsequent actions. We extend models of entrepreneurial intentions by drawing on action phase theory to better understand how entrepreneurial intentions translate into actions. Our study focuses on the effects of implementation intentions on taking entrepreneurial action. The analysis uses two waves of survey data on 422 individuals, from the Swedish general population, who had an explicit interest in starting a business and who reported on their actions 6 months later. We test and find support for a moderated mediation model in which implementation intentions mediate the effects of goal intentions on taking entrepreneurial action. We further find the mediated effect to be even stronger for those confirming a strong intention to start a new business. We provide an in-depth discussion of the concept of implementation intention and an extensive research agenda.

AB The current study compares the effectiveness of interventions that attempted to uniquely influence hypothesized determinants of behavior in the Theory of Planned Behavior versus some optimal combination of constructs (three constructs vs. four) to increase condom use among intentions and behavior college students. 317 participants (M-age=19.31; SDage=1.31; 53.3% female; 74.1% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to one of seven computer-based interventions. Interventions were designed using the Theory of Planned Behavior as the guiding theoretical framework. 196 (61.8%) completed behavioral follow-up assessments 3-month later. We found that the four construct intervention was marginally better at changing intentions (estimate=-.06, SE=.03, p=.06), but the single construct interventions were more strongly related to risky sexual behavior at follow-up (estimate=.04, SE=.02, p=.05). This study suggests that these constructs may work together synergistically to produce change (ClinicalTrials.gov Number NCT# 02855489).

AB Background Rooming-in, or keeping mothers and infants together throughout the birth hospitalization, increases breastfeeding initiation and duration, and is one of the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. Methods Results The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey is a biennial census of all birth facilities in the United States and its territories. Data from the 2007-2015 mPINC surveys were used to assess trends in the prevalence of hospitals with most (>= 90%) infants rooming-in more than 23 hours per day (ideal practice). Hospital practices among breastfed infants not rooming-in at night and reasons why hospitals without ideal rooming-in practices removed healthy, full-term, breastfed infants from their mothers' rooms were also analyzed. The percentage of hospitals with ideal practice increased from 27.8% in 2007 to 51.4% in 2015. Most breastfed infants who were not rooming-in were brought to their mothers at night for feedings (91.8% in 2015). Among hospitals without ideal rooming-in practices, the percentage removing 50% or more of infants from their mothers' rooms at any point during the hospitalization decreased for all reasons surveyed during 2007-2015; however, in 2015, hospitals still reported regularly removing infants for hearing tests (73.2%), heel sticks (65.5%), infant baths (40.2%), pediatric rounds (35.5%), and infant photos (25.4%). Conclusions Hospital implementation of rooming-in increased 23.6 percentage points during 2007-2015. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that all mothers who choose to breastfeed receive optimal lactation support during the first days after giving birth.

AB While social workers and researchers acknowledge the importance of a positive working alliance between service providers and clients, less is known about mechanisms for developing working alliances between supervisors and supervisees. The Alliance Building: Learning to Engage (ABLE) model was developed to measure and enhance the supervisory relationship. The ABLE model consists of a tool for continuous measurement of the supervisory working alliance as well as several research supported resources. This two part study assessed the reliability and validity of the ABLE supervision tool (ABLE-S), and then a randomized control trial pilot study was conducted to determine if the use of ABLE in supervision improves the professional quality of life and occupational self-efficacy for supervisees. Analyses revealed the ABLE-S tool is a reliable and valid form for measuring supervisory working alliance, but the use of ABLE in supervision did not have a significant effect on supervisee outcomes compared to the control group. The findings suggest additional training on proper implementation of ABLE and expanded measurements to capture several confounds inherent in the supervisory context are needed in future studies. Practical implications of using ABLE include effective strategies for promoting positive supervisee development and reducing negative effects of stressful work environments that often exist in the social service field.

AB Students with ADHD struggle substantially at the post-secondary transition. Yet, no empirical work identifies school-based intervention targets that specifically prepare graduating students for adjustment to this new phase of life. This study is a preliminary investigation of factors that promote success for students with ADHD during the post-secondary transition. Using qualitative methods, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 young adults with ADHD (age 18-21) and 12 parents of young adults with ADHD. Informants offered their perspectives of what factors were critical to post-secondary success and how (i.e., by what mechanisms) these factors influence young adult functioning. Twenty macrothemes were identified under three a priori categories: motivational, skills, and environmental factors. Two macrothemes outside of these categories were identified post hoc. Motivation and self-control difficulties were identified as the most commonly impairing deficits. Factors that enhanced and undermined these deficits were identified by parents and young adults. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB The customer cooperation level in behavior change programs (e.g., weight-loss programs, alcohol-quitting programs, and debt management programs) is low, which leads to a low program success rate. To address this problem, this study draws on the goal-driven behavior theory and develops a theoretical framework to explain how goal intention, and behavioral appraisal processes influence the subsequent cooperation behaviors, which, in turn, influence customers' goal attainment. A two-wave longitudinal survey was used to test the theoretical model. Results show that customers' appraisals of the cooperation behaviors play a vital role in influencing customers' cooperation behaviors. Three appraisal factors (self-efficacy, instrumental belief, and affect toward cooperation behaviors) fully mediate the relationship between goal intention and cooperation. Customer cooperation contributes directly to goal attainment. Both theoretical and managerial implications are provided.

AB Knowledge Management (KM) processes play a significant role in the implementation of various Information Systems (IS). Several review studies were carried out to afford a better understanding of the current research trend of KM processes. However, this issue still needs to be examined from other perspectives. It is observed that previous research neglects the examination of KM processes studies with regard to ISs. The current study systematically reviews and sheds the light on KM processes studies related to ISs aiming to provide a comprehensive analysis of 41 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2001 to 2018. The main findings of this study indicate that knowledge sharing is the most frequent KM process studied, followed by knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. Besides, questionnaire surveys were found to be the primarily relied research methods for data collection in the context of KM processes. In addition, 78% of the analyzed studies registered positive research outcomes. In terms of IS type, most of the analyzed studies focused on investigating the impact of KM processes on E-business systems, knowledge management systems, and IS outsourcing, respectively. Additionally, in terms of data collection, the majority of the analyzed studies were primarily focused on the participants who are IS executives/managers. Furthermore, most of the analyzed studies that achieved positive outcomes were carried out in China. To that end, this review study attempts to demonstrate and detail the recent increase in the interest and the advancement made in KM processes research considering ISs studies, which form an essential reference for scholars in KM field.

AB Research on mobile learning indicates that students perceive mobile devices mainly as communication and entertainment tools. Therefore, a key factor in successful mobile learning implementation is the initial measurement of students' acceptance of those devices into their learning. Countless language applications available suggest that mobile devices can be ideal tools for language learning. Surprisingly, there are few studies reporting students' acceptance of mobile assisted language learning (MALL), let alone MALL acceptance in developing countries. By adapting and extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model, the study assesses the dimensions affecting behavioral intentions and actual use of MALL. Data were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions influence students' attitudes towards using MALL. Accordingly, attitude is the factor that affects behavioral intention the most. The model also shows that behavioral intention has an effect on MALL use. The study concludes that students enrolled in higher education in developing countries such as Colombia have a positive attitude towards MALL. However, an improvement of facilitating conditions, along with a more influential role of the educational community is needed for a successful MALL integration in education.

AB As one of the most serious types of cyber attack, Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) have caused major concerns on a global scale. APT refers to a persistent, multi-stage attack with the intention to compromise the system and gain information from the targeted system, which has the potential to cause significant damage and substantial financial loss. The accurate detection and prediction of APT is an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a novel machine learning-based system entitled MLAPT, which can accurately and rapidly detect and predict APT attacks in a systematic way. The MLAPT runs through three main phases: (I) Threat detection, in which eight methods have been developed to detect different techniques used during the various APT steps. The implementation and validation of these methods with real traffic is a significant contribution to the current body of research; (2) Alert correlation, in which a correlation framework is designed to link the outputs of the detection methods, aims to identify alerts that could be related and belong to a single APT scenario; and (3) Attack prediction, in which a machine learning-based prediction module is proposed based on the correlation framework output, to be used by the network security team to determine the probability of the early alerts to develop a complete APT attack. MLAPT is experimentally evaluated and the presented system is able to predict APT in its early steps with a prediction accuracy of 84.8%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Florida, one of the world's most visited tourist destinations, holds one of the most vulnerable positions as a result of climate change. Through a quantitative survey, this study gathered the responses of 432 tourists who had previously visited Florida, with a hypothetical scenario of changed climatic conditions. The examination of the tourist perspective showed the presence of ample sunshine and factors related to beach comfort as the reasons for choosing the destination. In a scenario were beaches disappear and tropical diseases become more widespread, the majority of respondents stated they would choose a different destination. However, respondents would reconsider their intentions if adaptation measures such as reduced prices, coastal habitat conservation and measures to protect beaches from erosion and coastal areas from inundation were in place. The findings suggest that seasonal and geographic shifts in tourism demand could be mitigated by the implementation of adaptation measures at the destination level.

TI Evidence-Based Evaluation of eHealth Interventions: Systematic
   Literature Review

LA English
DT Review

   technology assessment
ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HEALTH INFORMATICS; FRAMEWORK; SUPPORT;
   INDIVIDUALS; MODEL; NEED
AB Background: Until now, the use of technology in health care was driven mostly by the assumptions about the benefits of electronic health (eHealth) rather than its evidence. It is noticeable that the magnitude of evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth is not proportionate to the number of interventions that are regularly conducted. Reliable evidence generated through comprehensive evaluation of eHealth interventions may accelerate the growth of eHealth for long-term successful implementation and help to experience eHealth benefits in an enhanced way.
   Objective: This study aimed to understand how the evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth can be generated through evaluation. Hence, we aim to discern (1) how evaluation is conducted in distinct eHealth intervention phases, (2) the aspects of effectiveness and efficiency that are typically evaluated during eHealth interventions, and (3) how eHealth interventions are evaluated in practice.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the evaluation methods for eHealth interventions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. We searched Google Scholar and Scopus for the published papers that addressed the evaluation of eHealth or described an eHealth intervention study. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps.
   Results: We intended to see how the process of evaluation unfolds in distinct phases of an eHealth intervention. We revealed that in practice and in several conceptual papers, evaluation is performed at the end of the intervention. There are some studies that discuss the importance of conducting evaluation throughout the intervention; however, in practice, we found no case study that followed this. For our second research question, we discovered aspects of efficiency and effectiveness that are proposed to be assessed during interventions. The aspects that were recurrent in the conceptual papers include clinical, human and social, organizational, technological, cost, ethical and legal, and transferability. However, the case studies reviewed only evaluate the clinical and human and social aspects. At the end of the paper, we discussed a novel approach to look into the evaluation. Our intention was to stir up a discussion around this approach with the hope that it might be able to gather evidence in a comprehensive and credible way.
   Conclusions: The importance of evidence in eHealth has not been discussed as rigorously as have the diverse evaluation approaches and evaluation frameworks. Further research directed toward evidence-based evaluation can not only improve the quality of intervention studies but also facilitate successful long-term implementation of eHealth in general. We conclude that the development of more robust and comprehensive evaluation of eHealth studies or an improved validation of evaluation methods could ease the transferability of results among similar studies. Thus, the resources can be used for supplementary research in eHealth.

AB BackgroundResidential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) are moving towards a Consumer Directed Care (CDC) model of care. There are limited examples of CDC in ageing research, and no evaluation of a comprehensive CDC intervention in residential care was located. This study will implement and evaluate a staff training program, Resident at the Center of Care (RCC), designed to facilitate and drive CDC in residential care.MethodsThe study will adopt a cluster randomized controlled design with 39 facilities randomly allocated to one of three conditions: delivery of the RCC program plus additional organizational support, delivery of the program without additional support, and care as usual. A total of 834 staff (22 in each facility, half senior, half general staff) as well as 744 residents (20 in each facility) will be recruited to participate in the study. The RCC program comprises five sessions spread over nine weeks: Session 1 clarifies CDC principles; Sessions 2 to 5 focus on skills to build and maintain working relationships with residents, as well as identifying organizational barriers and facilitators regarding the implementation of CDC. The primary outcome measure is resident quality of life. Secondary outcome measures are resident measures of choice and control, the working relationship between resident and staff; staff reports of transformational leadership, job satisfaction, intention to quit, experience of CDC, work role stress, organizational climate, and organizational readiness for change. All measures will be completed at four time points: pre-intervention, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-month follow-up. Primary analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis. Outcomes for the three conditions will be compared with multilevel linear regression modelling.DiscussionThe RCC program is designed to improve the knowledge and skills of staff and encourage transformational leadership and organizational change that supports implementation of CDC. The overarching goal is to improve the quality of life and care of older people living in residential care.

TI Feasibility assessment of an ergonomic baby wrap for kangaroo mother
   care: A mixed methods study from Nepal
SO PLOS ONE
LA English

ID BARRIERS
AB Background
   Kangaroo mother care, an evidence based practice and a national policy for management of low birth weight newborns in Nepal, is not widely practiced. This implementation research study aimed to explore the consumer preference and acceptability of the traditional and a new ergonomic wrap on the continuation of kangaroo mother care in the facility and community following discharge.
   Methods
   A mixed method feasibility study was done from May to October 2015. Ninety-six families of stable low birth weight newborns weighing 1800 to 2499 grams were counseled and taught to practice kangaroo mother care using both wraps. They were randomized into two groups of 48 with one group trying out the traditional wrap for the first six hours and the new wrap for the next six, and vice versa. Mothers were allowed to choose between the wraps for continuation of kangaroo mother care at the facility and post discharge. They were followed up telephonically weekly over 28 days postpartum to ascertain practice of kangaroo mother care. In-depth interviews with mothers (n = 12) and focus group discussions with health workers (n = 16) further evaluated the intervention. Descriptive statistics are presented for the quantitative part of the study.
   Results
   Mothers in the two groups chose the new wrap with no significant difference (81.3% vs 89.6%, p = 0.24). Of the 96 randomized mothers, 85% chose the new wrap. During the hospital stay, six mothers dropped out and remaining 90 mothers who were discharged with the intention of continuing Kangaroo Mother Care, 78 and 12 mothers did so with the new and traditional wrap respectively. New wrap users (429.1 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 351.7-470.3) performed skin-to-skin contact for an extra 77.4 hours overall than wrap (351.7 hours, 95%CI: 259.3-444) users from first day to 28 day postpartum. Health workers and mothers reported positive experience with the new wrap as it was easy to wear without assistance, secure and flexible to move around in kangaroo mother care position.
   Conclusions
   Involvement of mothers and families with provision of ergonomic wraps showed improvement in kangaroo mother care practice during hospital stay and at home.

AB Background: In resource-constrained settings, challenges with unique patient identification may limit continuity of care, monitoring and evaluation, and data integrity. Biometrics offers an appealing but understudied potential solution.
   Objective: The objective of this mixed-methods study was to understand the feasibility, acceptability, and adoption of digital fingerprinting for patient identification in a study of household tuberculosis contact investigation in Kampala, Uganda.
   Methods: Digital fingerprinting was performed using multispectral fingerprint scanners. We tested associations between demographic, clinical, and temporal characteristics and failure to capture a digital fingerprint. We used generalized estimating equations and a robust covariance estimator to account for clustering. In addition, we evaluated the clustering of outcomes by household and community health workers (CHWs) by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). To understand the determinants of intended and actual use of fingerprinting technology, we conducted 15 in-depth interviews with CHWs and applied a widely used conceptual framework, the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2).
   Results: Digital fingerprints were captured for 75.5% (694/919) of participants, with extensive clustering by household (ICC=.99) arising from software (108/179, 60.3%) and hardware (65/179, 36.3%) failures. Clinical and demographic characteristics were not markedly associated with fingerprint capture. CHWs successfully fingerprinted all contacts in 70.1% (213/304) of households, with modest clustering of outcomes by CHWs (ICC=.18). The proportion of households in which all members were successfully fingerprinted declined over time (rho=.30, P<.001). In interviews, CHWs reported that fingerprinting failures lowered their perceptions of the quality of the technology, threatened their social image as competent health workers, and made the technology more difficult to use.
   Conclusions: We found that digital fingerprinting was feasible and acceptable for individual identification, but problems implementing the hardware and software lead to a high failure rate. Although CHWs found fingerprinting to be acceptable in principle, their intention to use the technology was tempered by perceptions that it was inconsistent and of questionable value. TAM2 provided a valuable framework for understanding the motivations behind CHWs' intentions to use the technology. We emphasize the need for routine process evaluation of biometrics and other digital technologies in resource-constrained settings to assess implementation effectiveness and guide improvement of delivery.

AB Objective
   The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of using theory-based strategies on implementation intentions in promoting physical activity (PA) among adults.
   Methods
   This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. The search was carried out in seven electronic databases (LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Cochrane, Web of Science) and two searches of the "grey literature" were performed (Openthesis and OpenGrey). Randomized clinical trials (RCT), published up to September 2016, were considered eligible for this study. Two reviewers independently and systematically evaluated the eligibility criteria, and performed data extraction. A meta-analysis was performed for the purpose of comparing the effect between the intervention and control groups. The effect sizes were grouped in two subgroups with the purpose of more accurately verifying the effect caused by reinforcing the implementation intentions strategy, and using the inverse variance statistical method with random effects models to estimate the main effect of the implementation intention strategy on the PA behavior. Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated by using I-square statistics, and the Jadad scale to evaluate the quality of included papers.
   Results
   The search resulted in 12,147 records, of which 13 RCTs were considered eligible for this review. Sample age ranged from 18 to 76 years, and participants had conditions such as medullary lesion, coronary disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, sedentarism or occupational stress. When the summary of the effect was analyzed in the meta-analysis, the result found in the subgroup with reinforcement of the implementation intentions strategy was 0.25 (IC 95% = 0.05-0.45) in favor of the intervention group. This demonstrated that application of the implementation intentions strategy was capable of increasing PA practice in the participants of these studies, in comparison with others that did not use this reinforcement.
   Conclusion
   The findings of this review indicated that application of the theory of implementation intentions promoted PA behavior among the adults who received reinforcement of this strategy. The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database under the number CRD42018090482.

AB Background: Waterpipe tobacco smoking is a traditional method of tobacco use, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), but its prevalence is growing worldwide, especially among young people. Although often perceived as less harmful than other methods of tobacco use because the smoke passes through water, accumulating evidence shows harmful effects and that some smokers become addicted. Interventions that deglamourise and denormalise use have been recommended but little is known about the range and impact of different health prevention and promotion interventions.
   Methods: A scoping review of literature was undertaken to explore the breadth of literature and assess the range and impact of community based health promotion interventions for waterpipe smoking. Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Psychinfo, and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Interventions were classified using a health promotion framework and data extracted on the aspects of prevention/promotion addressed; key strategies employed, evidence of effectiveness or impact on behavior change as well as barriers to implementation and perceived success factors.
   Results: Ten studies were included in the review. They include brief interventions to increase quit rates; community campaigns to raise awareness and increase knowledge; web based health education and skill development to increase perceived risks and intention to quit; as well as studies that evaluated product labeling and opportunities for policy interventions to create healthy environments.
   Conclusions: The evidence base is small but growing. Brief interventions for waterpipe users, community campaigns, and web based tailored information can modify perceptions of addiction and increase intentions to quit. Product labeling may be an effective policy tool to curb waterpipe smoking. A range of policy interventions have been identified but not evaluated.

   (AFFIRM): a stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID STILLBIRTH RISK; STANDARDS; WEIGHT
AB Background 2.6 million pregnancies were estimated to have ended in stillbirth in 2015. The aim of the AFFIRM study was to test the hypothesis that introduction of a reduced fetal movement (RFM), care package for pregnant women and clinicians that increased women's awareness of the need for prompt reporting of RFM and that standardised management, including timely delivery, would alter the incidence of stillbirth. Methods This stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial was done in the UK and Ireland. Participating maternity hospitals were grouped and randomised, using a computer-generated allocation scheme, to one of nine intervention implementation dates (at 3 month intervals). This date was concealed from clusters and the trial team until 3 months before the implementation date. Each participating hospital had three observation periods: a control period from Jan 1, 2014, until randomised date of intervention initiation; a washout period from the implementation date and for 2 months; and the intervention period from the end of the washout period until Dec 31, 2016. Treatment allocation was not concealed from participating women and caregivers. Data were derived from observational maternity data. The primary outcome was incidence of stillbirth. The primary analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle, with births analysed according to whether they took place during the control or intervention periods, irrespective of whether the intervention had been implemented as planned. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT01777022. Findings 37 hospitals were enrolled in the study. Four hospitals declined participation, and 33 hospitals were randomly assigned to an intervention implementation date. Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec, 31, 2016, data were collected from 409 175 pregnancies (157 692 deliveries during the control period, 23 623 deliveries in the washout period, and 227 860 deliveries in the intervention period). The incidence of stillbirth was 4.40 per 1000 births during the control period and 4.06 per 1000 births in the intervention period (adjusted odds ratio [ aOR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.07; p= 0.23). Interpretation The RFM care package did not reduce the risk of stillbirths. The benefits of a policy that promotes awareness of RFM remains unproven. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

ID LAW
AB This paper describes the impact of the One World in Schools human rights education programme on the attitudes, self-efficacy and intention to act of a sample of Georgian secondary school students (n = 303). For the evaluation, a mixed approach was applied, combining pre/post experimental/control group design, post-programme teacher and student surveys, and focus groups (n = 48) with students. Data were collected from September 2014 to June 2015 in sampled Georgian schools. The analysis revealed that the programme had an impact in both the quantitative and qualitative parts of the research. In the qualitative part, the students reported a high level of empowerment thanks to the programme's activities, while the changes reported in the pre/post testing were rather moderate. Moreover, the programme seems to have influenced girls more than boys. The cultural context of the evaluation and the implications for further implementation of the programme are discussed as well.

AB The ageing of the global population is creating a crisis in chronic disease management. In the USA, 29 million people (or 9.3% of the population) suffer from the chronic disease of diabetes; according to the WHO, globally around 200 million people are diabetic. Left unchecked, diabetes can lead to acute and long-term complications and ultimately death. Diabetes prevalence tends to be the highest among those aged 65 and older (nearly 20.6%), a population which often lacks the cognitive resources to deal with the daily self-management regimens. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wireless sensor system which patients use in their own homes to capture daily activity, an important component in diabetes management. Following Fogg's 2009 persuasion theory, we mine the activity data and provide motivational messages to the subjects with the intention of changing their activity and dietary behaviour. We introduce a novel idea called "persuasive sensing" and report results from two home implementations that show exciting promise. With the captured home monitoring data, we also develop analytic models that can predict blood glucose levels for the next day with an accuracy of 94%. We conclude with lessons learned from these two home case studies and explore design principles for creating novel IoT systems.

AB Introduction: Prospective memory (PM) refers to remembering to execute a planned intention in the future. It can be divided into event- and time-based, according to the nature of the PM cue. Event-based PM cues can be classified as focal or non-focal. Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) have been found to be impaired in both event- and time-based PM. PM has been found to be improved by implementation intentions, which is an encoding strategy in the format of "if X then Y". This study examined the effect of implementation intentions on a non-focal event-based and a time-based PM task in patients with SCZ.Methods: Forty-two patients with SCZ and 42 healthy controls were allocated to either an implementation intention or a control PM instruction condition and were asked to complete two PM tasks. Results: Implementation intentions was found to improve performance in both the non-focal event-based and time-based PM tasks in patients with SCZ and healthy controls, with no costs to the ongoing task. The improvement in time-based PM performance in the implementation intentions condition was partially mediated by the frequency of clock checking behaviour. Conclusions: Implementation intentions can facilitate PM performance in patients with SCZ and has the potential to be used as a clinical intervention tool.

AB Background: Although a great deal of research has been undertaken from 1982 on TGfU, teachers consider its implementation to be complex and are reluctant to integrate it into their teaching practice. Furthermore, some TGfU literature does not suggest how it might be implemented and how problems might be overcome. On the other hand, a review of TGfU studies showed three shortcomings. First, most of them only compared TGfU with a technique-based approach in the school setting. Second, the studies did not follow the fidelity guidelines for models-based practice research and it is therefore difficult to contrast their results. Third, lesson design was not aligned on the principles of play. Thus, this study provide additional support for going forward from comparative studies in educational settings, and enacting an aligned TGfU unit of floorball contextualized in the principles of play. Purpose: To verify whether pupils improved in variables related to performance and adherence after the enactment of an aligned TGfU unit. Method: An eight lessons unit was designed, validated, and enacted using a mixed-methods quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design. Participants were 41 pupils (23 boys and 18 girls; M = 11.73, SD = .66 years old) from two regular physical education classes with the same teacher. The teacher was trained in the TGfU approach. In pre-test and post-test assessments, data from decision-making, technical execution, cover, support, game performance, game involvement, enjoyment, perceived competence, and intention to be physically active were collected, using the Game Performance Assessment Instrument, two psychological scales, and two focus groups interviews with the pupils and the teacher. We analysed quantitative data using t-tests and qualitative data following an open and axial coding based on the pre-existing categories. Results: Pupils improved in decision-making, technical execution, cover, support, game performance, game involvement, enjoyment, perceived competence, and intention to be physically active after implementation of the TGfU unit. The pupils and the teacher perceived improvement in all the variables analysed as a consequence of the intervention. Conclusion: After the implementation of the aligned TGfU floorball unit, pupils improved in the variables related to performance and adherence. Based on participants' key comments, four aspects appeared to be essential for the success of the unit: (a) the lesson design; (b) collaboration from planning to teaching the unit between the researcher and the teacher; (c) the inclusion of learning tasks linked with cover and support; and (d) the use of two reflective periods that helped pupils to understand and apply new knowledge.

AB To better understand consumers' fair trade purchasing intentions, this study proposed an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in which a new determinant, cosmopolitanism, was added to reflect consumers' global orientation and perception of fair trade coffee in the context of globalization. In addition, this study employed the construct of "purchase implementation intention" to address the gap between stated intention and actual behavior. To test the study's hypotheses, a random survey was administered to 400 participants in Seoul, South Korea, a key emerging market for fair trade coffee consumption. The data were analyzed using a hierarchical regression method. Our findings suggest that (i) attitudes toward purchasing fair trade coffee, subjective norms, and cosmopolitanism were significant factors in predicting purchase implementation intentions with regard to fair trade coffee; (ii) perceived behavioral control was not statistically significant; and (iii) cosmopolitanism had a partial moderating effect on purchase implementation intentions. To confirm the utility of purchase implementation intention, a choice experiment involving 145 undergraduate and graduate students was administered. The data were analyzed using logistic regression. Purchase implementation intention was shown to reflect consumers' actual choice of fair trade coffee. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB Recent large-scale randomized experiments find that helping people form implementation intentions by asking when and where they plan to act increases one-time actions, such as vaccinations, preventative screenings and voting. We investigate the effect of a simple scalable planning intervention on a repeated behavior using a randomized design involving 877 subjects at a private gym. Subjects were randomized into i) a treatment group who selected the days and times they intended to attend the gym over the next two weeks or ii) a control group who instead recorded their days of exercise in the prior two weeks. In contrast to recent studies, we find that the planning intervention did not have a positive effect on behavior.

AB This paper describes the process of design, development, and implementation of a complex, multi-component, tertiary prevention intervention aimed at stabilizing pathways out of homelessness, the Housing Outreach Project-Collaborative (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multi-organizational, cross-sector, inter-professional collaboration. This process-oriented paper aims to elucidate the rationale for and experience of implementing the three main components of HOP-C: case management, mental health treatment and peer support, as well as the processes that support this wrap-around intervention as a whole. This paper draws on qualitative process-oriented data (i.e. field notes and interviews with staff) collected over the course of the intervention, and integrates perspectives from multiple practitioners involved in this endeavour. Practitioners reported the diversity in the type and intensity of services offered to clients, the building of a close and communicative interprofessional and interagency team, as well as the development of broader connectivity between organizations and practitioners as significant strengths of this approach. Challenges and successes in implementation are explored with the intention of providing insight into ways in which other collaborative complex interventions might be approached in the youth homelessness sector.

AB Fashionable clothes resource suppliers are directly linked with resource consumers through the Internet, thus replacing the traditional model. With fashionable clothes as the products for renting, this study helps relevant enterprises understand the factors influencing consumers' adoption of renting and their attitude and behavioral intention towards clothes renting. Taking the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical foundation, this study thus adopts the technology acceptance model (TAM), the innovation diffusion theory (IDT), the structural equation model (SEM), and the collected information to develop a research methodology that is both theoretical and practical. According to the research results, compatibility matters the most in driving consumers to have a positive assessment and perception of online clothes renting in terms of behavior and attitude. Additionally, personal innovativeness has significant effects and can help relevant enterprises find their target markets. In terms of subjective norm, interpersonal relationship also has a significant influence, showing that consumers today pay much more attention to friends' information sources. The self-efficacy of the perceived behavioral control also has a noticeable impact. Therefore, relevant enterprises need to consider the operability of online clothes renting to prevent consumers from feeling frustrated in their ability to use it, thus reducing their use intention.

AB Background: Communication partners (CPs) find it challenging to communicate with people with communication disorders post-stroke. Stroke communication partner training (CPT) can enhance CPs' ability to support the communication and participation of people post-stroke. While evidence for the efficacy of aphasia-based CPT is strong, implementation in healthcare settings is unclear.
   Aims: To investigate Australian speech pathologists' current stroke CPT practices, factors influencing the implementation of CPT and how reported practice compares with the research evidence.
   Methods & Procedures: Speech pathologists in Australia who had worked with people post-stroke were invited to complete a 99-item online survey. The survey was informed by a comprehensive review of the literature review, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) intervention taxonomy, and the theoretical domains framework. data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis.
   Outcomes & Results: A total of 122 clinicians were surveyed. Most participants reported providing CPT to treat a range of post-stroke communication disorders. While 98.3% reported training familiar CPs, only 66.1% reported training unfamiliar CPs. Current stroke CPT practice is characterized by one to two < 1 h sessions of informal face-to-face education and skills training. Only 13.3% and 10.0% of participants used evidence-based published programmes with unfamiliar and familiar CPs respectively. The main barriers included the perceived lack of behavioural regulation, skills, reinforcement, beliefs about consequences, positive social influences and resources. The main facilitators included clinicians' intentions to provide CPT, perception of CPT as part of their role and perceived compatibility of CPT with clinical practice.
   Conclusion & Implications: A significant evidence-practice gap exists. Research exploring the implementation of stroke CPT in healthcare settings, expanding evidence to support CPT for the range of post-stroke communication disorders, developing freely accessible step-by-step CPT programmes that consider restrictions in current practice and providing explicit instructions of CPT best practice are warranted. A supportive workplace culture and freely accessible formal training opportunities are also needed.

AB The SMARTsize intervention embeds an evidence-based portion control intervention in regular dietetic care. This intervention was evaluated to explore (1) which patients participated, (2) the implementation process, and (3) the outcomes of the intervention. The intervention was evaluated with an observational study design including measures at baseline, and three, six, and nine months after the start of the program. Data concerning the process (participation, dose delivered, dose received, satisfaction) and the outcomes (self-efficacy, intention, portion control strategies, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were collected with forms and questionnaires filled out by dietitians and patients. Descriptive analyses, comparison analyses, and cluster analyses were performed. Patients were mainly obese, moderately to highly educated women of Dutch ethnicity. Use of the intervention components varied from 50% to 100% and satisfaction with the SMARTsize intervention was sufficient to good (grades 7.2-8.0). Statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvements were observed for self-efficacy (+0.5), portion control strategies (+0.7), and BMI (-2.2 kg/m(2)), with no significant differences between patients with or without counselling. Three clusters of patients with different levels of success were identified. To conclude, implementing an evidence-based portion control intervention in real-life dietetic practice is feasible and likely to result in weight loss.

AB Background Preconception carrier screening (PCS) provides the potential to empower couples to make reproductive choices before having an affected child. An important question is what factors influence the decision to use or not use PCS.
   Methods We analysed the relationship between knowledge, attitudes and intentions to participate in PCS using logistic regression in 832 participants in Western Australia.
   Results Two-thirds of participants said they would take the test, with 92% of these supporting screening for diseases reducing the lifespan of children and infants. Those who had good genetic knowledge were seven times more likely to intend to use PCS (p <= 0.001), while those with high genetic knowledge were four times more likely to (p=0.002) and raised concerns such as insurance and confidentiality.
   Decreasing genetic knowledge correlated positively with religiosity and apprehension (p <= 0.001), which correlated negatively with intention to use PCS (p <= 0.001). Increasing genetic knowledge correlated positively with factors representing positive attitudes (p <= 0.001), which correlated positively with intention to use PCS (p <= 0.001). Many participants with good genetic knowledge nevertheless answered questions that tested understanding incorrectly.
   80% of participants stated they would prefer to access the test through their general practitioners and 30% would pay up to $A200.
   Conclusions Knowledge is instrumental in influencing participation. Having good genetic knowledge may not be enough to understand core concepts of PCS and may impact informed decision-making. This study recommends that continuous education of health professionals and thus the community, in PCS is crucial to reduce misconceptions.

AB Virtual reality and active video games (VR/AVGs) are promising rehabilitation tools because of their potential to facilitate abundant, motivating, and feedback-rich practice. However, clinical adoption remains low despite a growing evidence base and the recent development of clinically accessible and rehabilitation-specific VR/AVG systems. Given clinicians' eagerness for resources to support VR/AVG use, a critical need exists for knowledge translation (KT) interventions to facilitate VR/AVG integration into clinical practice. KT interventions have the potential to support adoption by targeting known barriers to, and facilitators of, change. This scoping review of the VR/AVG literature uses the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to (1) structure an overview of known barriers and facilitators to clinical uptake of VR/AVGs for rehabilitation; (2) identify KT strategies to target these factors to facilitate adoption; and (3) report the results of these strategies. Barriers/facilitators and evaluated or proposed KT interventions spanned all but 1 and 2 TDF domains, respectively. Most frequently cited barriers/facilitators were found in the TDF domains of Knowledge, Skills, Beliefs About Capabilities, Beliefs About Consequences, Intentions, Goals, Environmental Context and Resources, and Social Influences. Few studies empirically evaluated KT interventions to support adoption; measured change in VR/AVG use did not accompany improvements in self-reported skills, attitudes, and knowledge. Recommendations to target frequently identified barriers include technology development to meet end-user needs more effectively, competency development for end-users, and facilitated VR/AVG implementation in clinical settings. Subsequent research can address knowledge gaps in both clinical and VR/AVG implementation research, including on KT intervention effectiveness and unexamined TDF domain barriers.

AB Pregnant women tend to exercise less than women who have not yet been pregnant. In the present study, which involves two studies, we aimed to construct an effective, individualized exercise counseling model for pregnant women. In study 1, a three-round session that involved 10 multidisciplinary health care experts reached a consensus via the Delphi method. In the preliminary study, two healthy pregnant women were recruited from the prenatal outpatient departments of hospitals in Taipei, Taiwan. Both of them were 32 years old and primipara. The results of study 1, the established five stages of the individualized exercise counseling model for pregnant women were as follows: assessment, defining barriers that interfere with achieving the target, planning, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation. In the preliminary study, we applied this counseling model of study 1 to 2 healthy pregnant women. The 5-stage counseling model can encourage pregnant women to begin to exercise or to continue exercising. We believe that this exercise counseling model can potentially be used by nurses. It can help them to encourage pregnant women to regularly exercise, and to promote exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle.

AB Despite the proliferation of health and nursing informatics applications in the past decade, factors influencing consumer acceptance of the applications are not well understood. This study was conducted to investigate factors affecting acceptance of a consumer-used nursing informatics application (ie, online health information portal) within the framework of the Technology Acceptance Model. A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 201 Chinese young adults were invited to participate in usability testing with a typical health information portal and to complete a self-report questionnaire measuring the model's constructs and five hypothesized variables drawn from consumer and portal characteristics. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test research hypotheses. Fifteen of the 22 research hypotheses were supported. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness predicted satisfaction and behavioral intention, respectively, over and above the portal and consumer characteristics examined in the study. All portal and consumer characteristics had significant, although varied, impacts on the original model constructs. This study demonstrated that an adapted Technology Acceptance Model, extended with portal and consumer characteristics, provides an effective means to understand consumer acceptance of health portals. The findings hold important implications for design and implementation strategies to increase the likelihood of acceptance of consumer-used nursing informatics applications.

ID GERMANY; ANXIETY; HEALTH
AB Objectives Over the past few years, there has been a considerable increase in online-based therapeutic services for people affected by depressive disorders. The efficacy and efficiency of these programmes is well documented by now. User acceptance is considered as a significant factor of success in establishing this new patient-centered care. Theory-based acceptance surveys can provide valuable scientific knowledge regarding long-term introduction.
   Methods A nationwide online survey was conducted to determine the attitude towards web-based psychotherapy services for depressive disorders, the current state of knowledge and the intention of 186 participants (124 female and 62 male participants; aged 21 and above) to use these services. The participants were recruited from support groups for depressive disorders. The determinants of the intention to use online therapy, which is included in the binary logistic regression, are based upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).
   Results Nearly two-thirds of the respondents could conceive making use of online-based therapeutic services in the near future. The perceived performance and expected effort proved to be significantly influential predictors regarding the intention to use. Specifically, these included an evaluation of the use of E-Mental Health to assist disease management, and better assessment of the course of one's disease.
   Conclusion The actual contribution of E-Mental Health is closely connected to technical and jurisprudential assessments. But also, it significantly depends on evidence-based issues as well as user orientation in research, development and implementation. The results offer an initial theory-based approach to an increased user-oriented technology research in health care, with further diversity criteria to be taken into account in the future.

AB Background Documentary analysis of existing information, such as newspaper articles, is an identified method for use in an assessment to provide a descriptive explanation of existing problems or assets. The intention of this case study is to explore the effectiveness of documentary analysis of newspaper articles as a tool to inform an assessment of factors influencing the implementation of a medical respite for the homeless. Two questions framed the assessment; (a) What was occurring or might occur that will affect the development of a medical respite; and (b) What opportunities or threats are generated as a result? Methods Results Articles from two local newspapers identified themes related to the three external forces of change that impact medical respites; (a) funding; (b) community resistance; and (c) the health care system. Three themes emerged: a) uncertain funding; b) neighborhood resistance, and c) improved access to healthcare would result from the Affordable Care Act. Conclusion Use of documentary analysis of newspaper articles provided applicable content for the assessment. Themes from the assessment informed strategic planning, such as addressing potential neighborhood resistance.

AB Youth Justice policy in Scotland, under the 'Whole System Approach' (WSA), progressively espouses maximum diversion, minimum intervention and the use of alternatives to custody wherever possible. Yet Scotland still has one of the highest imprisonment rates in Europe. To explore this discrepancy, this qualitative study used individual interviews and focus groups to document the experiences of 14 young males aged 16 and 17 in one Scottish young offenders' institution on their journeys to custody. Their experiences reveal the significant challenges faced in understanding, navigating and complying with the justice system, and also indicate that the consistent implementation of WSA is problematic. The disconnection between the intentions of the WSA policy and the practical implementation means that these vulnerable young people are not fully benefiting from the WSA. This article therefore highlights important gaps between policy, practice and lived experience in youth justice in Scotland.

AB We describe how a mobility behavior change support system, called Blaze, is able to achieve a shift in changing the travel behavior of university students. We identify a causal pathway linking the effect of the technology intervention to its behavioral outcome through the mediation of a number of variables. The stage model of self-regulated behavioral change (SSBC) is used as a theoretical framework to understand how the outcome may be influenced by determinants (conceptual theory), and how the determinants may be activated by different intervention types (action theory). Using longitudinal data from a social experiment conducted over a month at a university in the Philippines, we test three hypotheses regarding the mechanism of change induced by Blaze. Our main findings suggest, in agreement with SSBC, that travel behavior change is achieved by a transition through a temporal sequence of four stages: predecision, pre-action, action and post action. In an extension from SSBC, we further distinguish post-action depending on whether the behavior is on initiation or under maintenance. We observe that the former (initiation) is characterized by instability (either relapse or progress), while the latter (maintenance) by stability. Moreover, we validate most of the determinants of intentions as postulated by the stage model. Finally, we find that that Blaze can significantly change only the proximate implementation intention and not the more distal ones (e.g. goal and behavioral intentions). We discuss the implications of our results on the potential role of technology interventions in mobility management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-regulation strategies are helpful for increasing goal commitment and maintaining behavior change. Evidence suggests that the self-regulation strategy of mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) shows promise in helping people increase their physical activity. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether these self-regulation strategies would increase physical activity, which would, in turn, improve well-being and mental health. In a quasi-experimental study, participants were randomized by school to an experimental group (n=40) and control group (n=45). The experimental group received self-regulation strategies, whereas the control group did not. Both groups were given a Fitbit and the goal of 10,000 steps per day. Participants' well-being and depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms were measured at baseline and after the 3-week intervention. The experimental group's physical activity increased from 7,938 to 9,288 steps per day (p=0.001), whereas that of the control group did not increase. In the experimental group, the findings suggested a significant increase for men, and a nonsignificant increasing trend for women. The study demonstrated the benefits of self-regulation strategies such as MCII on achieving physical activity goals. Findings also suggested that self-regulation strategies provided improvement beyond physical activity by decreasing the depressive symptoms of female participants in the experimental group. Given the small sample size, effects by gender have to be interpreted with caution. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Background Methods Inconsistent use of the contraceptive pill and condoms contributes significantly to poor sexual health outcomes for young people. There is evidence that action planning interventions may improve pill and condom use, but this approach is not systematically used in sexual healthcare. This study is the first to assess acceptability and feasibility of evaluating a digital intervention to support action plan formation for three sexual health behaviours with clinic attendees. It also considered the role of trait self-control and whether the intervention supported production of quality plans. Eighty-eight integrated sexual health clinic attendees aged 14-24 years (M = 20.27 years) were recruited to a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Of these, 67 also completed three-month follow-up. Measures included self-reported contraceptive or condom "mishaps", theory of planned behaviour variables, and a measure of self-control. Results Conclusions Descriptive analyses supported study acceptability and feasibility. The intervention supported pill and condom users to produce quality plans, though potential improvements were identified. Bivariate correlations suggested that high levels of trait self-control may negatively influence plan quality. Data suggest that the intervention may reduce pill or condom "mishaps". A future full RCT is likely feasible and brief digital action planning interventions may usefully be incorporated within sexual healthcare.

AB Technology adoption has become a favored strategy in urban water supply systems management to reduce the impact of changes in both climatic conditions and urban population growth. The urban water supply system of Ghana is conventional, with perceived rare use of modern technology. The adoption of water technology innovations by professionals who form part of the key stakeholders of water supply development is supposedly a precondition for improving the urban water supply systems. In the study, the attributes of diffusion of innovation model are applied to predict the intention of professionals' adoption to new water technologies using the structural equation model. The study finds that professionals' intention to adopt water technology innovations are influenced by the relative advantage; complexity and compatibility characteristics. Trialability and observability variables insignificantly influence the adoption of water technologies in the context of Ghana urban water supply system.

AB Background Fluoropyrimidine treatment can result in severe toxicity in up to 30% of patients and is often the result of reduced activity of the key metabolic enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), mostly caused by genetic variants in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD). We assessed the effect of prospective screening for the four most relevant DPYD variants (DPYD*2A [rs3918290, c.1905+1G>A, IVS14+1G>A], c.2846A>T [rs67376798, D949V], c.1679T>G [rs55886062, DPYD*13, I560S], and c.1236G>A [rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3]) on patient safety and subsequent DPYD genotype-guided dose individualisation in daily clinical care.
   Methods In this prospective, multicentre, safety analysis in 17 hospitals in the Netherlands, the study population consisted of adult patients (>= 18 years) with cancer who were intended to start on a fluoropyrimidine-based anticancer therapy (capecitabine or fluorouracil as single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy). Patients with all tumour types for which fluoropyrimidine-based therapy was considered in their best interest were eligible. We did prospective genotyping for DPYD*2A, c.2846A>T, c.1679T>G, and c.1236G>A. Heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers received an initial dose reduction of 25% (c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A) or 50% (DPYD*2A and c.1679T>G), and DPYD wild-type patients were treated according to the current standard of care. The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 grade >= 3) overall fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity across the entire treatment duration. We compared toxicity incidence between DPYD variant allele carriers and DPYD wild-type patients on an intention-to-treat basis, and relative risks (RRs) for severe toxicity were compared between the current study and a historical cohort of DPYD variant allele carriers treated with full dose fluoropyrimidine-based therapy (derived from a previously published meta-analysis). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02324452, and is complete.
   Findings Between April 30, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, we enrolled 1181 patients. 78 patients were considered non-evaluable, because they were retrospectively identified as not meeting inclusion criteria, did not start fluoropyrimidine-based treatment, or were homozygous or compound heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers. Of 1103 evaluable patients, 85 (8%) were heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers, and 1018 (92%) were DPYD wild-type patients. Overall, fluoropyrimidine-related severe toxicity was higher in DPYD variant carriers (33 [39%] of 85 patients) than in wild-type patients (231 [23%] of 1018 patients; p=0.0013). The RR for severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity was 1.31 (95% CI 0.63-2.73) for genotype-guided dosing compared with 2.87 (2.14-3.86) in the historical cohort for DPYD*2A carriers, no toxicity compared with 4.30 (2.10-8.80) in c.1679T>G carriers, 2.00 (1.19-3.34) compared with 3.11 (2.25-4.28) for c.2846A>T carriers, and 1.69 (1.18-2.42) compared with 1.72 (1.22-2.42) for c.1236G>A carriers.
   Interpretation Prospective DPYD genotyping was feasible in routine clinical practice, and DPYD genotype-based dose reductions improved patient safety of fluoropyrimidine treatment. For DPYD*2A and c.1679T>G carriers, a 50% initial dose reduction was adequate. For c.1236G>A and c.2846A>T carriers, a larger dose reduction of 50% (instead of 25%) requires investigation. Since fluoropyrimidines are among the most commonly used anticancer agents, these findings suggest that implementation of DPYD genotype-guided individualised dosing should be a new standard of care.

   GUIDELINES
AB Full integration of oncology and palliative care relies on the specific knowledge and skills of two modes of care: the tumour-directed approach, the main focus of which is on treating the disease; and the host-directed approach, which focuses on the patient with the disease. This Commission addresses how to combine these two paradigms to achieve the best outcome of patient care. Randomised clinical trials on integration of oncology and palliative care point to health gains: improved survival and symptom control, less anxiety and depression, reduced use of futile chemotherapy at the end of life, improved family satisfaction and quality of life, and improved use of health-care resources. Early delivery of patient-directed care by specialist palliative care teams alongside tumour-directed treatment promotes patient-centred care. Systematic assessment and use of patient-reported outcomes and active patient involvement in the decisions about cancer care result in better symptom control, improved physical and mental health, and better use of health-care resources. The absence of international agreements on the content and standards of the organisation, education, and research of palliative care in oncology are major barriers to successful integration. Other barriers include the common misconception that palliative care is end-of-life care only, stigmatisation of death and dying, and insufficient infrastructure and funding. The absence of established priorities might also hinder integration more widely. This Commission proposes the use of standardised care pathways and multidisciplinary teams to promote integration of oncology and palliative care, and calls for changes at the system level to coordinate the activities of professionals, and for the development and implementation of new and improved education programmes, with the overall goal of improving patient care. Integration raises new research questions, all of which contribute to improved clinical care. When and how should palliative care be delivered? What is the optimal model for integrated care? What is the biological and clinical effect of living with advanced cancer for years after diagnosis? Successful integration must challenge the dualistic perspective of either the tumour or the host, and instead focus on a merged approach that places the patient's perspective at the centre. To succeed, integration must be anchored by management and policy makers at all levels of health care, followed by adequate resource allocation, a willingness to prioritise goals and needs, and sustained enthusiasm to help generate support for better integration. This integrated model must be reflected in international and national cancer plans, and be followed by developments of new care models, education and research programmes, all of which should be adapted to the specific cultural contexts within which they are situated. Patient-centred care should be an integrated part of oncology care independent of patient prognosis and treatment intention. To achieve this goal it must be based on changes in professional cultures and priorities in health care.

AB Prior research has estimated the impact of an autonomous vehicle (AV) environment on the mobility of underserved populations such as adult non-drivers. What is currently unknown is the impact of AVs on enhancing the mobility of children who are also mobility disadvantaged, as child passengers are likely part of AV ridership scenarios in the perceivable future. To address this question, our study collected perceived benefits and concerns of AVs from a US convenience sample of parents whose children relied on them for mobility. We found that parents' intentions to travel in AV and their technology readiness as well as parent (sex, residence area) and child (age, restraint system) demographic profiles were important determinants of potential AV acceptance and impact. In addition, two groups of potential AV users emerged from the data: the curious and the practical. This study addresses a gap in the literature by assessing parents' perspectives on using AVs to transport children. The results have great potentials to guide the design of mobility features, safety evaluations, and implementation policies, as a decline in public interest in AVs has been recently documented.

AB The present research sought to (i) understand the challenges that dog owners encounter in helping their pet lose weight, and (ii) develop and test an intervention designed to help dog owners to deal with these challenges. A series of focus groups (N = 79 dog owners, veterinarians, and industry experts) informed the content of an intervention designed to prompt owners to form if-then plans (or "implementation intentions") identifying challenges (e.g., inclement weather) and specifying how to respond (e.g., play with the dog indoors). This intervention was evaluated in a single-blind, randomized controlled trial (N = 106 owners of overweight dogs) against a control condition who were simply asked to set relevant goals. Changes in the owners' beliefs, behaviour, and the dog's weight and body condition were measured around 2 months later. The primary finding was that dogs in the intervention condition lost the same percentage of their body weight on average each week (M = -0.065, SD = 0.65) as dogs in the control condition (M = -0.24, SD = 0.55), F(1, 36) = 0.70, p = .41, eta(2) = .019, although it should be noted that follow-up data was only available for around half of the sample. Analysis of the factors that were associated with changes in weight among the dogs in the trial suggested that owners' lack of knowledge about appropriate feeding and exercise was associated with poorer outcomes, suggesting that future interventions may need to provide information and help owners to set appropriate goals before encouraging them to make if-then plans to support the implementation of those goals.

AB Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use is increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM), condoms remain key to HIV prevention. Implementation intentionswhich link a behavioral action plan with a situation or cuemay predict condom use. The Strength of Implementation Intentions Scale (SIIS), which assesses condom use implementation intentions, has not been evaluated among MSM. A structural model tested whether the SIIS mediated the relationship between condom use intentions and condomless sex acts among 266 sexually-active MSM (56% White, 26% Black, 15% Latino, M-age = 32.54). After controlling for PrEP use, HIV-status, and demographics ((2)(107) = 140.06, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.03), the SIIS fully mediated the relationship between condom use intentions and condomless sex acts. The SIIS can serve as a fidelity check for interventions, a mediator in theoretical models, and future studies should incorporate implementation intentions into HIV prevention interventions for MSM. ResumenAunque el uso de la profilaxis de prexposicion (PrEP) esta aumentando entre los hombres que tienen sexo con hombres (HSH), los condones siguen siendo clave para la prevencion del VIH. La implementacion de intencionesque vinculan un plan de accion conductual con una situacion o senalpueden predecir el uso del condon. La Escala de Fuerza de la Implementacion de Intenciones (EFII), cual evalua la implementacion de intenciones del uso del condon, aun no ha sido analizada entre los HSH. Un modelo estructural evaluo si la (EFII) mediaba la relacion entre las intenciones del uso del condon al igual que los actos sexuales sin condon entre 266 HSM que son sexualmente-activos (56% Blancos, 26% Negros, 15% Latinos, edad M = 32.54). Despues de controlar el uso de la PrEP, estado del VIH, y demografia ((2)(107) = 140.06, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.03), la escala EFII completamente media la relacion entre las intenciones del uso del condon al igual que los actos sexuales sin condon. La EFII puede servir como un control de fidelidad en las intervenciones, un mediador en modelos teoricos, y los estudios futuros deberian considerar la incorporacion de la implementacion de intenciones para la prevencion del VIH entre los HSH.

AB Self-help interventions for parents, which have a behavioral basis, are considered to be an effective treatment option for children with externalizing disorders. Nonbehavioral approaches are widely used but have little empirical evidence. The main objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of a behavioral and a nonbehavioral guided self-help program for parents. Families of children (aged 4-11 years) diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were randomized to either a behavioral or a nonbehavioral guided self-help program including 8 parenting booklets and 10 counseling telephone calls. The analyses considered the ratings of 5 informants: blinded clinician, therapist, participant, (her or his) partner, and teacher. Of the 149 families randomized to treatment (intention-to-treat sample [ITT]), 110 parents completed the intervention (per-protocol sample [PP]). For the 4 primary outcome measures (blinded clinician- and participant-rated ADHD and ODD) at post assessment, the analysis revealed a treatment advantage for the behavioral group in blinded clinician-rated ODD symptoms (ITT: d = 0.37; PP: d = 0.35). Further treatment differences, all in favor of the behavioral group (ITT and PP), were detected in therapist ratings (i.e., ODD) and participant ratings (e.g., parental self-efficacy [only PP], negative parenting behavior, parental stress). In both samples, no differences were found at post-assessment for ratings of the partner and the teacher, or at the 12-month follow-up (only participant ratings available). Behavioral guided self-help shows some treatment advantage in the short term. No superiority over nonbehavioral therapy was detected 12 months after treatment termination.

AB Chronic hepatitis C treatment with direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy during incarceration is an attractive option, due to its short duration and to the possibility of directly observed treatment or supervision. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and rates of discontinuation of DAA treatment in prisoners and nonprisoners. We studied all patients treated in the 10 prisons of Catalonia and at 3 public hospitals in the Barcelona area between 1 January 2015 and 30 April 2016. We analysed sustained viral response (SVR) and rates of discontinuation through intention-to-treat and modified-intention-to-treat analyses, the latter excluding discontinuations due to release from prison. One hundred and eighty-eight inmates and 862 noninmates were included. Prisoners were significantly younger than nonprisoners, with higher proportions of men, drug users, HIV infection, genotypes 1a and 3 and more treatment with psychiatric drugs. Overall, 98.4% of patients completed treatment. The discontinuation rate was low, but higher in inmates (3.7% vs 1.2% noninmates; P=.003) and in community patients >65years old (2.8% vs 1.2% in under 65seconds; P=.008). Among the inmates, 7 (42.8%) discontinuations were due to release. SVR was 93.1% in inmates vs 96.5% in noninmates (P=.08) by intention-to-treat and 95.1% vs 96.5% (P=.37) by modified intention-to-treat. Virologic failure rates were similar (3.8% vs 3% in noninmates; P=.60). SVR, virologic failure and discontinuation rates were similar in inmates and noninmates. Currently, prisons are considered a priority for the implementation of DAA. Improved coordination between penitentiary and community health systems would help to ensure therapeutic continuity in released prisoners.

AB Objective: Greater time that patients take to present symptoms to health care providers (HCPs) increases the likelihood of later stage cancer, which increases mortality and morbidity in symptomatic cancers. The common-sense model (CSM) is used to understand time to first consultation with a healthcare provider, but inconsistencies exisy between its current use and important empirical findings.
   Method: To resolve inconsistencies, we conducted a qualitative examination to determine how the CSM could be revised to better account for these findings. We conducted in-depth interviews of a consecutive sample of 38 recently diagnosed patients who described events from first noticing symptoms to first consultation. Framework analysis was used to develop a theoretical model of processes leading to presentation or non-presentation.
   Results: Patients reported median presentation times of 3-4 weeks. Early presentation was facilitated by pre-symptomatic perceptions of vulnerability to serious illnesses and beliefs that early intervention could mitigate illness. These patients rarely tried to identify symptoms. They responded inductively, seeking help because symptoms were unusual. Where patients did not describe pre-symptom perceptions of vulnerability, many deductively tried to identify symptoms but misattributed them to minor conditions. Pre-symptomatic perceptions of vulnerability could also prolong presentation. When vulnerability was characterized by intense fears of cancer and cancer treatment, patients tended to avoid thinking about symptoms which extended presentation time.
   Conclusion: Risk perception theories explain how participants' pre-symptomatic perceptions of vulnerability and potential treatment outcomes influence presentation time. Incorporating risk perception perspectives into the CSM can improve its ability explain responses to ambiguous symptoms.

AB Objective: Consumers' willingness to allow the distribution of their health data is a prerequisite for the success of any health information exchange (HIE) initiative. Several mechanisms are being used by healthcare organizations to exchange health information electronically. Our goal is to investigate how patients' preferences regarding information exchange (i.e., privacy concern, opt-in intention, and perceived health information sensitivity) are affected by different HIE models and exchange architectures.
   Methods: We designed a series of scenarios for controlled online experiments. Totally, 1416 respondents participated in seven experiments. Each experiment includes a separate scenario and 27 questions to measure outcome variables and demographics. Data were collected from a wide range of adult population in the U.S. and all the experiments were performed in English.
   Results: The findings demonstrate that there are significant differences in patients' perceptions of different HIE mechanisms in terms of privacy concern and opt-in intention. Consumers believe that the patient-controlled HIE at the regional level is the most preferred model to protect health information privacy and they are willing to opt-in to this model. However, there is no solid evidence to show that different HIE mechanisms would affect the consumers' perceived health information sensitivity.
   Conclusions: This study supports the importance of patient-controlled HIE models that potentially enable patients to access, manage, integrate, and share their medical information with multiple healthcare organizations. The results show in-depth consumer adoption patterns across multiple HIE models and architectures which are required to identify optimal approaches for HIE implementation using different exchange mechanisms.

ID LEARNING DESIGN; ANALYTICS; REFLECTION
AB Learning design is a research field which studies how to best support teachers as designers of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) situations. Although substantial work has been done in the articulation of the learning design process, little is known about how learning designs are experienced by students and teachers, especially in the context of schools. This paper empirically examines if a teacher inquiry model, as a tool for systematic research by teachers into their own practice, facilitates the connection between the design and data-informed reflection on TEL interventions in two school communities. High school teachers participated in a learning design professional development program supported by a web-based community platform integrating a teacher inquiry tool (TILE). A multiple case study was conducted aimed at understanding: (a) current teacher practice and (b) teacher involvement in inquiry cycles of design and classroom implementations with technologies. Multiple data sources were used over a one year period including focus groups transcripts, teacher interview protocols, digital artifacts, and questionnaires. Sharing teacher-led inquiries together with learning analytics was perceived as being useful for connecting pedagogical intentions with the evaluation of their enactment with learners, and this differed from their current practice. Teachers' reflections about their designs focused on the time management of learning activities and their familiarity with the enactment and analytics tools. Results inform how technology can support teacher-led inquiry and collective reflective practice in schools.

AB Aims and objectivesTo identify initiatives aimed at retaining ethnically diverse students in Bachelor/Baccalaureate undergraduate nursing programmes. The review focused on identifying strategies attempting to address this issue.
   BackgroundThere is a recognised shortage of ethnically diverse registered nurses (RN) worldwide. Multiple strategies have been implemented internationally to create a more linguistically and culturally diverse RN workforce. Governments have invested significant resources into these strategies, but the outcomes have been variable. If a future RN workforce is to be representative of their populations, then effective evidence-based interventions are required.
   DesignAn integrative review of the literature published from January 2006-December 2015.
   MethodCINAHL, PubMed, ProQuest, ERIC and Cochrane databases were searched using the key terms student nurse, attrition and retention to identify papers. The CASP tools were used to evaluate relevant studies for rigour (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme [CASP], 2017). Seventeen papers were identified for inclusion. The findings from these studies were analysed using thematic analysis.
   ResultsFour themes emerged from the analysis: prediction, recruitment and retention, single approach and multiple approaches.
   ConclusionsMany factors affect the processes of retaining ethnically diverse student nurses in a Bachelor/Baccalaureate undergraduate programme. Programme single approaches appear to be limiting; however, implementation of a broad range of strategies across the continuum from recruitment to graduation is likely to be a more appropriate solution to achieving higher graduation rates amongst ethnically diverse students.
   Relevance to clinical practiceSupporting the recruitment and retention of ethnically diverse students assists in greater numbers of RNs graduating and provides a more linguistically and culturally diverse workforce representative of their population.

AB Objective: To investigate the cross-sectional association between personal physical activity (PA) level, Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs toward PA promotion, and PA promotion behavior among smoking cessation advisors.
   Method: 149 smoking cessation advisors were invited to complete online questionnaires. Hypotheses were tested using Bayesian path analysis.
   Results: Attitudes and perceived behavioral control (PBC) of smoking cessation advisors were related to PA promotion intentions; intentions were in turn related to PA promotion behaviors. Advisors' personal PA level was indirectly associated with PA promotion behaviors through PBC and PA promotion intentions.
   Conclusion: The TPB is a relevant theoretical framework with which to explore determinants of PA promotion behavior among smoking cessation advisors. The PA level of health care professionals may be linked to PA promotion behavior through some TPB constructs.
   Practice implications: Smoking cessation advisor training should include education on attitude development (e.g., PA benefits on smoking cessation), PBC (e.g., modality of PA prescription) and PA promotion intentions (e.g., goal setting). Smoking cessation advisors should also be encouraged to regularly practice PA in order to improve their PA promotion behaviors. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: When performed erroneously, the venous blood specimen collection (VBSC) practice steps patient identification, test request management and test tube labeling are at high risk to jeopardize patient safety. VBSC educational programs with the intention to minimize risk of harm to patients are therefore needed. In this study, we evaluate the efficiency of a large-scale online e-learning program on personnel's adherence to VBSC practices and their experience of the e-learning program.
   Methods: An interprofessional team transformed an implemented traditional VBSC education program to an online e-learning program developed to stimulate reflection with focus on the high-risk practice steps. We used questionnaires to evaluate the effect of the e-learning program on personnel's self-reported adherence to VBSC practices compared to questionnaire surveys before and after introduction of the traditional education program. We used content analysis to evaluate the participants free text experience of the VBSC e-learning program.
   Results: Adherence to the VBSC guideline high-risk practice steps generally increased following the implementation of a traditional educational program followed by an e-learning program. We however found a negative trend over years regarding participation rates and the practice to always send/sign the request form following the introduction of an electronic request system. The participants were in general content with the VBSC e-learning program.
   Conclusions: Properly designed e-learning programs on VBSC practices supersedes traditional educational programs in usefulness and functionality. Inclusion of questionnaires in the e-learning program is necessary for follow-up of VBSC participant's practices and educational program efficiency.

AB This paper investigates the passive and active control strategies to provide a physical assistance and rehabilitation by a 7-DOF exoskeleton robot with nonlinear uncertain dynamics and unknown bounded external disturbances due to the robot user's physiological characteristics. An Integral backstepping controller incorporated with Time Delay Estimation (BITDE) is used, which permits the exoskeleton robot to achieve the desired performance of working under the mentioned uncertainties constraints. Time Delay Estimation (TDE) is employed to estimate the nonlinear uncertain dynamics of the robot and the unknown disturbances. To overcome the limitation of the time delay error inherent of the TDE approach, a recursive algorithm is used to further reduce its effect. The integral action is employed to decrease the impact of the unmodeled dynamics Besides, the Damped Least Square method is introduced to estimate the desired movement intention of the subject with the objective to provide active rehabilitation. The controller scheme is to ensure that the robot system performs passive and active rehabilitation exercises with a high level of tracking accuracy and robustness, despite the unknown dynamics of the exoskeleton robot and the presence of unknown bounded disturbances. The design, stability, and convergence analysis are formulated and proven based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory. Experimental results with healthy subjects, using a virtual environment, show the feasibility, and ease of implementation of the control scheme. Its robustness and flexibility to deal with parameter variations due to the unknown external disturbances are also shown.

ID DILATION
AB In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), affective computation extends parameterization by including implicit user information, e.g. galvanic skin responses or heart rate variability. Physiological responses are generally involuntary and measurements primarily derive emotional features to differentiate cognitive and affective states. Biofeedback applications externalize covert physiological responses and allow interference by means of simple cognitive techniques. Here, signal responses do not necessarily indicate cognitive or affective dispositions but depict a user's intention. As demonstrated recently, even pupil diameter is subject to explicit control, albeit with individually varying degrees of success. The current study explores to what extent users can transfer implicit events (here: pupil size changes) into explicit input requests. In Experiment 1 we carried out biofeedback sessions to determine individual strategies to achieve cognitive control on pupil dilation. In Experiment 2 we applied explicit pupil dilations as input commands in a visual search-and-select task. Implementation of varying thresholds ensured the involvement of different levels of cognitive effort to exceed selection criteria. Results show that a short period of freely exploring the mechanisms of action enabled most subjects to achieve cognitive control on pupil dilation, even during increased tonic activation provoked by high task load. Hence, the associated dynamics no longer define automatic events but indicate the degree of explicitness to be imposed upon implicit processing. During pupil-based object selection, a strict criterion was associated with a high cognitive load, prolonged selection times and a notable number of time-outs, whereas a soft criterion correlated with fast selections and low cognitive demands. Together with the outcome of a user survey, the current findings suggest explicit pupil size changes constitute an appropriate selection mechanism for HCI even in the context of high cognitive workload.

AB BackgroundImplementing evidence-based care requires healthcare practitioners to do less of some things (de-implementation) and more of others (implementation). Variations in effectiveness of behaviour change interventions may result from failure to consider a distinction between approaches by which behaviour increases and decreases in frequency. The distinction is not well represented in methods for designing interventions. This review aimed to identify whether there is a theoretical rationale to support this distinction.MethodsUsing Critical Interpretative Synthesis, this conceptual review included papers from a broad range of fields (biology, psychology, education, business) likely to report approaches for increasing or decreasing behaviour. Articles were identified from databases using search terms related to theory and behaviour change. Articles reporting changes in frequency of behaviour and explicit use of theory were included. Data extracted were direction of behaviour change, how theory was operationalised, and theory-based recommendations for behaviour change. Analyses of extracted data were conducted iteratively and involved inductive coding and critical exploration of ideas and purposive sampling of additional papers to explore theoretical concepts in greater detail.ResultsCritical analysis of 66 papers and their theoretical sources identified three key findings: (1) 9 of the 15 behavioural theories identified do not distinguish between implementation and de-implementation (5 theories were applied to only implementation or de-implementation, not both); (2) a common strategy for decreasing frequency was substituting one behaviour with another. No theoretical basis for this strategy was articulated, nor were methods proposed for selecting appropriate substitute behaviours; (3) Operant Learning Theory makes an explicit distinction between techniques for increasing and decreasing frequency.DiscussionBehavioural theories provide little insight into the distinction between implementation and de-implementation. Operant Learning Theory identified different strategies for implementation and de-implementation, but these strategies may not be acceptable in health systems. Additionally, if behaviour substitution is an approach for de-implementation, further investigation may inform methods or rationale for selecting the substitute behaviour.

AB BackgroundPhase synchrony has extensively been studied for understanding neural coordination in health and disease. There are a few studies concerning the implications in the context of BCIs, but its potential for establishing a communication channel in patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders remains totally unexplored. We investigate, here, this possibility by estimating the time-resolved phase connectivity patterns induced during a motor imagery (MI) task and adopting a supervised learning scheme to recover the subject's intention from the streaming data.MethodsElectroencephalographic activity from six patients suffering from neuromuscular disease (NMD) and six healthy individuals was recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition. The metric of Phase locking value (PLV) was used to describe the functional coupling between all recording sites. The functional connectivity patterns and the associate network organization was first compared between the two cohorts. Next, working at the level of individual patients, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) to discriminate between left and right based on different instantiations of connectivity patterns (depending on the encountered brain rhythm and the temporal interval). Finally, we designed and realized a novel brain decoding scheme that could interpret the intention from streaming connectivity patterns, based on an ensemble of SVMs.ResultsThe group-level analysis revealed increased phase synchrony and richer network organization in patients. This trend was also seen in the performance of the employed classifiers. Time-resolved connectivity led to superior performance, with distinct SVMs acting as local experts, specialized in the patterning emerged within specific temporal windows (defined with respect to the external trigger). This empirical finding was further exploited in implementing a decoding scheme that can be activated without the need of the precise timing of a trigger.ConclusionThe increased phase synchrony in NMD patients can turn to a valuable tool for MI decoding. Considering the fast implementation for the PLV pattern computation in multichannel signals, we can envision the development of efficient personalized BCI systems in assistance of these patients.

AB Enduring physical strain is an important ability and prototypically required in athletic activities. However, little is known about the psychological determinants of endurance performance and their underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated self-regulation as one such factor. We recruited 60 participants who hold intertwined rings for as long as possible while avoiding contacts between them, either with a goal intention or an implementation intention to perform well. Performance was measured in terms of time-to-failure and contact errors. Additionally, we repeatedly assessed ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and pain (RPP) and used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to continuously monitor cerebral oxygenation in dorsal and ventral parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), brain regions associated with effortful attentional control and response inhibition, respectively. Performance, RPE and RPP were similar in the goal and the implementation intention condition. LPFC activity increased over time, but its activation level was generally lower in the implementation intention condition. Both effects were particularly pronounced in the dorsal LPFC. Moreover, the balance between effortful and more automatic regulation seems to differ between self-regulation strategies. Our results indicate that self-regulation plays an important role in endurance performance and that self-regulatory processes during endurance performance might be reflected in LPFC activation.

AB BackgroundCommunity organizations can have difficulty implementing evidence-based prevention programs. More research is needed on implementation support interventions designed to help these organizations implement programs with quality.MethodsPreparing to Run Effective Programs (PREP) is a randomized controlled trial testing Getting To Outcomes (GTO), a 2-year implementation support intervention. It compares 15 Boys and Girls Club sites implementing CHOICE (control group), a five-session evidence-based alcohol and drug prevention program, with 14 similar sites implementing CHOICE supported by GTO (intervention group). PREP replicates a previous GTO study that had the same design, but featured a teen pregnancy prevention program instead. All sites received typical CHOICE training. Fourteen intervention sites received GTO manuals, training, and onsite technical assistance to help practitioners complete implementation best practices specified by GTO (i.e., GTO steps). During the first year, technical assistance providers helped the intervention group adopt, plan, and deliver CHOICE. Then, this group was trained on evaluation and quality improvement steps of GTO using feedback reports summarizing their own data, which yielded revised plans for subsequent implementation of CHOICE. This paper presents results regarding GTO's impact on CHOICE fidelity (adherence, quality of delivery, dosage) and the proximal outcomes of the youth participants (aged 10-14)attitudes and intentions regarding cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana use. Fidelity was assessed at all sites by observer ratings and attendance logs. Proximal outcomes were assessed via survey at baseline, 3, and 6months.ResultsAfter 1year, fidelity and proximal outcomes were similar between Intervention and control groups. After 2years (which included GTO quality improvement activities that took place between years 1 and 2), intervention sites had higher ratings of CHOICE adherence and quality of delivery (dosage remained similar). Proximal outcomes did not differ between groups in either year, although there was universally high endorsement of prosocial responses to those outcomes from the start.ConclusionsFindings suggest that systematic implementation support provided by GTO can help community organizations achieve better fidelity. Findings replicate the implementation results from a previous GTO study using the same design, but with a different evidence-based program and different fidelity measures. Although proximal outcomes did not change, in large part due to ceiling effects, the implementation findings suggest GTO can support a variety of programs.Trial registrationThis project is registered at ClinicalTrials.govwith number NCT02135991. The trial was first registered on May 12, 2014.

AB Unlike the corporate sector, where resources to support job satisfaction are available, many nonprofits experience challenges retaining qualified management staff. A better understanding of how to maintain job satisfaction is important to increase tenure of qualified managers. The goal of this study was to explore how social justice orientation and organizational commitment influence job satisfaction and intention to leave nonprofit agencies. A sample of 107 middle managers were recruited from New York City settlement house organizations via email invitation to participate in an online cross-sectional survey. Study aims sought to measure whether middle manager's orientation to social justice was associated with (1) job satisfaction, intention to stay with the agency and (2) if these associations were mediated by their commitment to their agency. Findings suggest that organizational commitment plays a critical role in the relationship between social justice, job satisfaction and intention to stay. Findings from this study will help us better understand how leadership may be able to improve middle management job satisfaction through staff development and implementation of strategies to enhance organizational commitment for these critical staff members.

AB Background: Recent research posits that anti-tobacco health warnings on cigarette packaging may gradually lose their effectiveness in dissuading adolescents from tobacco products several years after implementation. Health warnings on individual cigarette sticks represent a novel warning medium, and may further educate adolescents on the dangers associated with smoking, and reduce tobacco experimentation amongst this vulnerable population.
   Methods: In an online survey of school students in Queensland, Australia, participants were requested to rate (on five-point Likert scales) and comment on the perceived effectiveness of current cigarette packaging warnings, and 12 text warnings on cigarette sticks, in preventing non-smokers from smoking, and encouraging current smokers to quit. The warnings were divided into four themes to establish the most effective types of anti-tobacco messages: mortality statistics, health condition consequences, social and financial consequences, and supportive messages. These themes were based on current anti-tobacco interventions within Australia, and the rising cost of tobacco products, and designed to align with the Health Belief Model.
   Results: Participants (N = 150; Age = 15-18) from five schools completed the survey, and generally viewed current packaging warnings as gross and disgusting, and rating them as somewhat effective in preventing non-smokers from smoking. Current warnings were however considered less effective in prompting current smokers to quit with participants describing them as being un-relatable to teenagers, and smokers as having become desensitized to the warnings used. One theme of cigarette-stick warning (mortality statistics) was rated as significantly more effective (p < 0.001) than current cigarette packaging, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.67-4.62). Overall, warnings were considered to be 4.71 times (95%Cl: 2.72-6.43, p < 0.001) more effective on non-smokers than on smokers. Over three-quarters of participants supported using health warnings on individual cigarette sticks.
   Conclusions: Current cigarette packaging warnings have retained some effectiveness in dissuading adolescents from smoking, though novel and thought-provoking text-only warnings on cigarette sticks may serve as an additional intervention in reducing tobacco use. Further research requires identification of the most effective warnings, and the perceptions of a more diverse participant base.

AB Background: Several Asian countries have implemented pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs as suggested by the World Health Organization with various policies based on countries' systems. The study is aimed to analyse multiple research studies on the perceived effectiveness of Pictorial Health Warnings as a deterrent to smoking intention and as a stimulant of smoking behaviour in smokers and non-smokers in Asian countries.
   Method: Peer-reviewed articles were identified through multiple science databases indexed by Scopus, MEDLINE or PubMed. The review was limited to articles that reported original research findings, were conducted in Asian countries and were available for review by January 2010. A PRISMA Flow diagram was used to identify the articles through the process of data screening and extractions.
   Result: A total of 14 original articles which met the criteria were included in the review, consisting of 12 quantitative studies and 2 studies with both quantitative and qualitative methods from 17 jurisdictions. The reviewed studies found that pictorial health warnings were associated with a greater perception of salience (reading and noticing the warning), emotional effects, and cognitive increase. Additionally, in the reviewed studies, pictorial health warnings were perceived as more effective in deterring smoking initiation and encouraging smoking cessation than text-only warnings. Several studies also evaluated the effectiveness of a new pictorial warning compared with the old one. However, the relevance of refreshing the pictures of pictorial health warnings and the length of the effective period of the implementation of pictorial health warnings were less frequently studied.
   Conclusion: Pictorial health warnings perceived as more effective in deterring smoking initiation among non-smokers and as well as in stimulating smoking cessation among smokers.

AB As anger can lead to aggressive behavior aiming at intentionally hurting somebody, the prevention of its destructive consequences with effective emotion regulation strategies is crucial. Two studies tested the idea that mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) interventions would be effective in down-regulating anger. In Study 1, participants who adopted the self-regulation strategy of MCII showed significantly less anger-related negative affect after the anger induction than participants in a control condition, with positive affect staying unaffected. Results from a second study with a control condition plus three self-regulation conditions - a reappraisal, a MCII, and a reappraisal C MCII condition - suggest that participants using MCII were effective in down-regulating anger, irrespective of whether it was supplemented by reappraisal or not. The present research contributes to emotion regulation research by introducing MCII as an effective strategy that can be tailored to satisfy individual emotion regulation demands, such as dealing with experienced anger.

AB Background: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in community settings, and they are associated with significant psychological distress, functional and social impairment. While cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most consistently efficacious psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, barriers preclude widespread implementation of CBT in primary care. Transdiagnostic group CBT (tCBT) focuses on cognitive and behavioural processes and intervention strategies common to different anxiety disorders, and could be a promising alternative to conventional CBT. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic group CBT for anxiety disorders program as a complement to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in primary mental health care.
   Methods/Design: The trial is a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up at 4, 8 and 12-months design. Treatment and control groups. a) tCBT (12 weekly 2-h group sessions following a manualized treatment protocol); b) TAU for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria comprise meeting DSM-5 criteria for primary Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients are recruited in three regions in the province of Quebec, Canada. The primary outcome measures are the self-reported Beck Anxiety Inventory and the clinician-administered Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5); secondary outcome measures include treatment responder status based on the ADIS5, and self-reported instruments for specific anxiety and depression symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and service utilisation. Statistical analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects regression model will be used to account for between-and within-subject variations in the analysis of the longitudinal effects of the intervention.
   Discussion: This rigorous evaluation of tCBT in the real world will provide invaluable information to decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. Widespread implementation of tCBT protocols in primary care could lead to better effectiveness, efficiency, access and equity for the large number of patients suffering from anxiety disorders that are currently not obtaining evidence-based psychotherapy.

AB Goal-setting theory states that challenging, specific, and concrete goals (i.e., subordinate goals) are powerful motivators and boost performance in goal pursuit more than vague or abstract goals (i.e., superordinate goals). Goal-setting theory predominantly focuses on single, short-term goals and less on broad, long-term challenges. This review article extends goal-setting theory and argues that superordinate goals also fulfill a crucial role in motivating behavior, particularly when addressing broad, long-term challenges. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the benefits of superordinate goals, which have received less attention in research, and to show theoretically that people pursue long-term goals more successfully when they focus on subordinate as well as superordinate goals than when they focus on either subordinate or superordinate goals alone.

DE Regional Higher Education; Individual Advantage Characteristic;
   Competitiveness Evaluation
AB Objective recognition of higher education development status and competitiveness is an important prerequisite and foundation for the transformation and development of regional higher education. At present, the identification and analysis methods for solving this problem cannot get rid of the subjective intention of reviewers or managers completely, and still adopt a unified evaluation standard. This makes the credibility of the results not high, resulting in not ideal implementation of follow-up policies and measures. In view of this, this paper proposes a method of individual advantage feature recognition to identify and evaluate regional higher competitiveness. This method is based on the description of the multi-indexes system of objects, and chooses the goal programming evaluation method to construct the mathematical model of individual superiority characteristic recognition, and explores the individual superiority characteristics of the regional higher education. This evaluation structure has intuitive interpretation and is easy to understand and accept.

AB The original intention of the "the Belt and Road" strategy is to promote the economic development in countries and regions along the route through technological, capital, cultural and educational exchanges. However, the flow of infrastructure and personnel is bound to pose serious challenges to the ecological environment of the countries and regions along the route. Therefore, the research on how to strengthen the education of environmental awareness of mobile personnel is of great significance for promoting the smooth implementation of "the Belt and Road" strategy. Based on the popular phenomenon of short-term overseas study tour of college students in recent years, this paper conducts the association study of the environmental education for college students before overseas study tour and "the Belt and Road" strategy based on the overall analysis of the ecological environment status of the countries and regions along "the Belt and Road". The research results show that the pre-school environmental education has a positive impact on the smooth implementation of "the Belt and Road". The importance analysis and education content recommendations of environmental education for college students before overseas study tour in this paper is conducive to expanding the international influence of the "green development concept" advocated by China. Meanwhile, it is of great practical significance for the smooth implementation of the Belt and Road" strategy.

AB Binge-eating disorder (BED) is related to deleterious physical, social, and psychological outcomes among adolescents, and is more common among racial and ethnic minorities. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment for disorders of emotion dysregulation, has demonstrated efficacy in treating disordered eating patterns. While DBT interventions have demonstrated success among adults with BED, less is known about adaptation of DBT for adolescents presenting with BED and subthreshold binge-eating behaviors. This paper describes the Emotional Overeating Intervention, a 10-week DBT skills-based group intervention for adolescents exhibiting binge-eating behaviors. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist is used to describe the intervention with the intention of providing necessary details to implement the intervention in clinical practice or replicate the intervention for further study. The rationale for a condensed version of DBT, potential modifications for future implementation, and the importance of adapting the intervention in a developmentally and culturally responsive manner are discussed. This adapted treatment modality can guide future studies examining interventions for adolescents exhibiting binge-eating behaviors.

AB Mobile applications are becoming a preferred delivery method for the government sector and contributing to more convenient and timely services to citizens. This study examines the intention to use mobile applications for the government services (mG-App) in Oman. This study extended the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by including two constructs namely trust and information quality. Data were collected from 513 mobile application users across Oman. The research model was analysed in two stages. First, structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to determine significant determinants affecting users' acceptance of mG-App. In the second stage, a neural network model was used to validate SEM results and determine the relative importance of determinants of acceptance of mG-App. The findings revealed that trust and performance expectancy are the strongest determinants influencing the acceptance of mG-App. The findings of this research have provided theoretical contributions to the existing research on mG-App and practical implications to decision-makers involved in the development and implementation of mG-App in in Oman.

ID PERSPECTIVE; ADOPTION; PORTALS; IMPACT
AB U.S. cities, among the vanguards of open data globally, are investing in renewed efforts to support Open Government with the creation of open data portals that are used to provide machine-readable administratively collected data sets. Transparency of the public sector is still widely seen as the main outcome of these efforts. Such a simplistic view, however, misses the rich variety of innovations resulting from open data use. We conceptualize these innovation outcomes across two dimensions: internal/external and product/process. Interviews with 15 city managers in the U.S. who are responsible for the implementation of open data policies were conducted to compare policy intentions, perceived innovation outcomes as well as actual ones. The findings show that product-centric outcomes are predominant and relate mainly to external innovation, including applications, websites and new services. Process-centric outcomes constitute rather internal innovation, such as procedural changes and the revival of innovation culture in government. We close with a set of recommendations for open data efforts in government that include structural, procedural, as well as cultural changes for successful open data initiatives.

AB Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective strategy to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though its utilization rate is low. One reason for this low utilization rate is that nurses do not provide COPD patients with enough health education to increase the patient's motivation for PR participation. This study examined knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intention toward PR promotion. The study also investigated the correlates of behavioral intentions to promote PR among pulmonary nurses.
   A cross-sectional correlational design was used. Overall, 284 nurses (all women) from chest medicine and general internal medicine wards in 3 hospitals within Midwest Taiwan were recruited. Data were collected by anonymous, self-administered questionnaires. We aimed to understand if there would be differences in the Chest Medicine and Generalist nurses on these outcomes, given the specialty versus generalist nature of their practice. Results were analyzed using multiple linear regressions.
   Although the 2 groups of nurses (ie, Chest Medicine, General Medicine) showed no differences in PR knowledge, attitudes, or behavioral intentions, they lacked sufficient PR knowledge and skills. The accuracy rate of PR knowledge was approximately 12% and self-evaluated PR skills were less than 50%. Self-efficacy in promoting PR was above average (ie, 57%-60%), and the strength of attitudes and behavioral intentions was over 70%. A multiple linear regression revealed that behavioral intentions of nurses working in the chest medicine ward were influenced by behavioral attitudes, and also PR skills and self-efficacy (explanatory power 33.3%).
   Attitudes, skills, and self-efficacy heavily affected pulmonary nurses' ability to promote PR; however, PR knowledge and skills remain low. Therefore, future implementation of practical PR training courses is needed to strengthen nurses' behavioral intentions toward PR promotion.
   Improved pulmonary rehabilitation-related skill, attitudes, clinical experience of PR programs, and/or practical PR training are needed among both generalist and specialist nurses. Education courses and clinical practice training should be increased in the future to promote pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD patients.

AB The Malaysian Government through the National Health Policy aims to improve health outcomes through public pharmaceutical healthcare services. Pharmacy Value Added Services (PVAS) was introduced as a matter of public pharmaceutical health policy. PVAS is an important service to improve clinical outcomes by improving compliance, monitoring and even information dissemination. However, adoption rates are low and therefore hampering the achievement of national health policy goals. Our objective is to explore the key determinants and moderators of successful implementation of new public pharmaceutical services by investigating the cognitive perspectives of patients' intentions to adopt with the Theory of Planned Behavior as the theoretical framework. A two-phase mixed methodology involving first a qualitative exploration and the second a quantitative phase was conducted in public health facilities in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey (N = 410) was conducted using the Pharmacy Value Added Services Questionnaire (PVASQ). Multiple regression and robust moderation analysis were performed. Overall, perspectives were found to be significant predictors of intentions. In greater detail, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, knowledge, expectations and ethnicity were found to be significant predictors of intentions to adopt PVAS. Perspectives and expectations are found to exert significant partial effects on intentions. We find that a significant self-reinforcing feedback loop exists between Expectations-Perspectives-Intentions. Positive perspectives and meeting the high expectations of the public can greatly improve the uptake of the new service. Ethnicity plays a crucial role in determining uptake of the new service and should be given greater focus. Our results are robust and suggests that a bottom-up approach should be key to successful implementation of health policies and services.

AB Objective: Recent research emphasizes the importance of habit in explaining patterns of energy intake and choices of consumption. However, the nature of the association between habit strength and snacking has not been explored for all types of between-meal snacks.
   Design: Multilevel linear techniques were used to: (i) examine the association between habit strength and moment-to-moment energy intake (kilocalories) from snacks in daily life; and (ii) determine whether gender, age, level of education and BMI moderate the association between habit strength and moment-to-moment energy intake from snacks. A smartphone application based on the experience sampling method was used to map momentary between-meal snack intake in the context of daily life. Demographics and habit strength were assessed with an online composite questionnaire.
   Setting: This research was performed in the Netherlands in the natural environment of participants' daily life.
   Subjects: Adults (n 269) aged 20-50 years.
   Results: Habit strength was significantly associated with moment-to-moment energy intake from between-meal snacks in daily life: the higher the strength of habit to snack between meals, the higher the amount of momentary energy intake from snacks. The association between habit strength and moment-to-moment energy intake from snacks was moderated by education level. Additional analyses showed that habit strength was significantly associated with moment-to-moment energy intake from between-meal snacks in the low to middle level of education group.
   Conclusions: It is recommended to address habitual between-meal snacking in future interventions targeting low- to middle-educated individuals.

AB Global biosphere issues call for an education for sustainable consumption decisions. Enabling adolescent learners to form sustainable consumption intentions involves an understanding of underlying internal predictors. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) delivers a useful approach to this challenge. Understanding of the underlying motives behind sustainable consumption decision-making, however, requires knowledge and evaluation of three basic sustainability aspects, the generational, the coherence, and the spatial aspect. As yet, the TPB framework does not take account of those facets. In this paper, we propose an extension of the TPB that meets these shortcomings by integrating the sustainability aspects while including the concepts of sustainability knowledge and sustainability values into the existing model. Furthermore, we extended the functional range of the attitude construct to the three sustainability aspects. The objective of the present article is to introduce and discuss the adapted framework which can serve as a first step for an educational implementation of the concept of sustainable consumption.

AB A number of severe flooding events have occurred both in South Africa and internationally in recent years. Furthermore, changes in both the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events have been documented, both locally and internationally, associated with climate change. The recent loss of life, destruction of infrastructure, and associated economic losses caused by flooding, compounded by the probability of increased rainfall variability in the future, highlight that design flood estimation (DFE) techniques within South Africa are outdated and in need of revision. A National Flood Studies Programme (NFSP) has recently been initiated to overhaul DFE procedures in South Africa. One of the recommendations in the NFSP is the further development of a continuous simulation modelling (CSM) system for DFE in South Africa. The focus of this paper is a review of CSM techniques for DFE, to guide further development for application in South Africa. An introduction to DFE, and particularly the CSM approach, is presented, followed by a brief overview of DFE techniques used in South Africa, leading into a more detailed summary of CSM for DFE within South Africa to date. This is followed by a review of the development and application of CSM methods for DFE internationally, with a focus on the United Kingdom and Australia, where methods have been developed with the intention of national scale implementation. It is important to highlight that there is a plethora of CSM methods available internationally and this review is not exhaustive; it focuses on and identifies some of the strengths and weaknesses of several popular methods, particularly those intended for national scale application, as the intended outcome from this review is to identify a path towards the development of a usable national scale CSM system for DFE in South Africa. Emphasis on a usable method is important, considering the reality that, despite promising results, numerous benefits, and national scale methods being developed, it appears that the CSM method for DFE is rarely used in practice.

AB Background: Deficient communication during shift change can cause negative patient outcomes and hinder person-centeredness in care. Person-centered handover is performed together with the patient at bedside, with the intention of providing a safe and efficient handover while promoting patient participation. The knowledge about nurse perspectives on handover models that involve patient participation is sparse.
   Objective: To describe registered nurses' perceptions of person-centered handover in an oncological inpatient setting. Design" A qualitative interview study.
   Setting: The study was undertaken at two oncological inpatient wards at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, where person-centered handover was implemented in 2015.
   Participants: Registered nurses who had worked at the wards for at least six months. We aimed for a full sample investigation. All eligible nurses (n = 13) were approached, and 11 chose to participate. Participants' age ranged from 23 to 60 years, the mean work experience was 10 years, and 4 out of 11 nurses were oncology nurse specialists.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were performed by an independent researcher. The data was analyzed using content analysis with an inductive approach.
   Results: Three main themes with ten subsequent subthemes emerged from the data. The main themes were: clinical communication and assessment; opportunity for patient participation; consequences for nursing care. In general, the nurses were positive towards person-centered handover, but they expressed concerns regarding patients' integrity and insecurities regarding bedside communication. All nurses described how they aimed at enhancing patient participation and viewed person-centered handover as an opportunity, but still perceived it difficult to succeed due to drawbacks and factors hindering nursing care. Overall, the nurses were positive regarding the involvement of patients in the handover procedure. Information provision from nurse to patient, as opposed to information exchange, was predominant.
   Conclusions: The intentions of person-centered handovers differed from the way it was actually performed, especially in regards to the obtained levels of patient participation, as described by nurses. Professional insecurity in relation to bedside communication with patients and their visitors is a novel finding that should be considered when implementing person-centered handovers. Overall, the perceptions of person-centered handovers, as expressed by the nurses, enhance our understanding of what to consider when implementing the model and why compliance may vary.

AB Background: Between 50% and 80% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) (i.e. constipation and faecal incontinence) that affects quality of life and can lead to hospitalisation.
   Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of abdominal massage plus advice on bowel symptoms on PwMS compared with advice only. A process evaluation investigated the factors that affected the clinical effectiveness and possible implementation of the different treatments.
   Design: A randomised controlled trial with process evaluation and health economic components. Outcome analysis was undertaken blind.
   Setting: The trial took place in 12 UK hospitals.
   Participants: PwMS who had 'bothersome' NBD.
   Intervention: Following individualised training, abdominal massage was undertaken daily for 6 weeks (intervention group). Advice on good bowel management as per the Multiple Sclerosis Society advice booklet was provided to both groups. All participants received weekly telephone calls from the research nurse.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the difference between the intervention and control groups in change in the NBD score from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes were measured via a bowel diary, adherence diary, the Constipation Scoring System, patient resource questionnaire and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L).
   Results: A total of 191 participants were finalised, 189 of whom were randomised (two participants were finalised in error) (control group, n = 99; intervention group, n = 90) and an intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The mean age was 52 years (standard deviation 10.83 years), 81% (n = 154) were female and 11% (n = 21) were wheelchair dependent. Fifteen participants from the intervention group and five from the control group were lost to follow-up. The change in NBD score by week 24 demonstrated no significant difference between groups [mean difference total score -1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.32 to 0.04; p = 0.0558]; there was a significant difference between groups in the change in the frequency of stool evacuation per week (mean difference 0.62, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.21; p = 0.039) and in the number of times per week that participants felt that they emptied their bowels completely (mean difference 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.76; p = 0.002), in favour of the intervention group. Of participant interviewees, 75% reported benefits, for example less difficulty passing stool, more complete evacuations, less bloated, improved appetite, and 85% continued with the massage. A cost-utility analysis conducted from a NHS and patient cost perspective found in the imputed sample with bootstrapping a mean incremental outcome effect of the intervention relative to usual care of -0.002 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% CI -0.029 to 0.027 QALYs). In the same imputed sample with bootstrapping, the mean incremental cost effect of the intervention relative to usual care was 56.50 pound (95% CI -372.62 pound to 415.68) pound. No adverse events were reported. Limitations include unequal randomisation, dropout and the possibility of ineffective massage technique.
   Conclusion: The increment in the primary outcome favoured the intervention group, but it was small and not statistically significant. The economic analysis identified that the intervention was dominated by the control group. Given the small improvement in the primary outcome, but not in terms of QALYs, a low-cost version of the intervention might be considered worthwhile by some patients.

AB Background: Registering details of thoracic surgical activity has a long tradition in Hungary. Implemented first as a procedure based register, characteristics of the treatment, complications and outcomes has been noted for the last three decades. Although the limitations of the used database hindered the scientific analysis in the dataset and restricted the possibility of benchmarking. The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) database is offering a specialty-specific, procedure-specific, web-based electronic database for data contribution enabling international comparisons. Our aim was to accommodate and implement the ESTS database as the new Hungarian national thoracic surgical registry.
   Methods: In 2014, cooperation of the ESTS Database Committee and the Hungarian Society of Thoracic Surgery evolved a new structure for contributing national thoracic surgical data, called the ESTS database "Hungarian model". The European dataset was translated into Hungarian, extended questionnaire and continuous data access helped the completion of the dataset. The "Hungarian model" was incorporated into the common practice of all the thoracic surgical centers in Hungary.
   Results: In the first year of its implementation the "Hungarian model" of the ESTS dataset became the platform to use for contributing thoracic surgical data in Hungary. All the data included in the dataset were completed and periodically analyzed to form the annual Hungarian report ("the Hungarian Silver Book"). The dataset is permanently accessible for national scientific analysis and serves as a basis for quality improvement intentions.
   Conclusions: The Hungarian model proved to be able to serve as a national database. The complete dataset of the thoracic activity has become eligible for scientific analysis and international benchmarking, highlighting the most important core messages of the ESTS database project of improving quality and patient safety thoracic surgeons. By creating a framework for a national registry the system is incorporating an alternative for other thoracic surgical societies.

AB Recent findings challenge the widely held motto of never give up in goal striving. There are situations in which it is of strategic interest to abandon an important goal and allocate resources to an alternative goal. The ability to realize whether a goal is attainable or not (and therefore the ability to make the right choice between goal persistence and goal disengagement or reengagement) is influenced by at least two key motivational factors: motivation for goal striving and a self-regulatory technique called mental contrasting with implementation intentions. The interplay between these two factors is as yet unexplored but holds promise for several conceptual and practical advancements in understanding the pursuit of challenging life goals. To this end, we propose a tripartite model of goal striving that integrates goal motivation and goal regulation.

AB PurposeThe present study tested the efficacy of a theory-based online intervention comprising motivational (autonomy support) and volitional (implementation intention) components to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.MethodUndergraduate students (N=202) completed self-report measures of constructs from psychological theories, pre-drinking alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related harm at baseline and were randomly assigned to one of four intervention conditions in a 2 (autonomy support: present/absent)x2 (implementation intention: present/absent) design. Participants completed follow-up measures of all variables at 4weeks post-intervention. All participants received national guidelines on alcohol consumption and an e-mail summary of intervention content at its conclusion. Participants also received weekly SMS messages in the 4-week post-intervention period restating content relevant to their intervention condition.ResultsNeither statistically significant main effect for either the autonomy support or implementation intention intervention components nor an interaction effect was found on the outcome measures. However, statistically significant reductions in pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm were observed across all groups at follow-up, when compared to baseline.ConclusionReductions in outcome measures were likely related to elements common to each condition (i.e., provision of national guidelines, assessment of outcome measures, e-mail summary, and SMS messages), rather than motivational and volitional components.

AB Long-standing social problems such as poor achievement, personal and intergroup conflict, bad health, and unhappiness can seem like permanent features of the social landscape. We describe an approach to such problems rooted in basic theory and research in social psychology. This approach emphasizes subjective meaning-making-working hypotheses people draw about themselves, other people, and social situations; how deleterious meanings can arise from social and cultural contexts; how interventions to change meanings can help people flourish: and how initial change can become embedded to alter the course of people's lives. We further describe how this approach relates to and complements other prominent approaches to social reform, which emphasize not subjective meaning-making but objective change in situations or in the habits and skills of individuals. In so doing, we provide a comprehensive theoretical review and organization of a psychologically informed approach to social problems, one that encompasses a wide-range of interventions and applies to diverse problem areas.

AB Major steps towards implementation of autonomous and connected transport are being taken nowadays. The trend of automation technology being used in vehicles by the most important vehicle manufacturing industries is expected to move closer to high or fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) through technological advancements in sectors of robotics and artificial intelligence. Vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities are planning to be available on market, in full scale, in the next years. In the longer term substantial benefits are mainly expected for accessibility to transport, safety, traffic flow, emissions, fuel use and comfort. All these potential societal benefits will not be achieved unless AVs are accepted and used by a critical mass of people. Addressing these challenges, this paper: (a) proposes a technology acceptance modelling process by extending the original Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explain and predict consumers' intensions towards AVs, (b) based on the proposed TAM-extended framework, a 30 question survey was conducted in order to investigate the factors influencing consumers' in tensions to use and accept AVs. Results show that the constructs of perceived usefulness, perceived ease to use, perceived trust and social influence, are all useful predictors of behavioral intentions to have or use AVs, with perceived usefulness having the strongest impact. The insights derived from this study could significantly contribute to ongoing research related to technology acceptance of AVs and are expected to allow automobile industries to improve their design and technology.

Yoga and mindfulness practices have been demonstrated as successful complementary and alternative approaches to managing the impacts of stress trauma. This study explores the feasibility and acceptability of mindfulness programming for yoga teachers in the Nairobi region of Kenya. Grounded theory is used to explore survey results. Outcomes demonstrate promise for both acceptability and feasibility. Curriculum tools were viewed as effective, and participants indicated intention to both utilize and share tools. Reflections on program effectiveness and impacts are addressed, as are potential considerations for improved program translation. Findings suggest the potential benefit for future collaborations, and also suggest best practices considerations for global implementation of embodied mindfulness programming.

AB Background: eHealth interventions show stronger effects when informed by solid behavioral change theories; for example, self-regulation models supporting people in translating vague intentions to specific actions have shown to be effective in altering health behaviors. Although these theories inform developers about which behavioral change techniques should be included, they provide limited information about how these techniques can be engagingly implemented in Web-based interventions. Considering the high levels of attrition in eHealth, investigating users' experience about the implementation of behavior change techniques might be a fruitful avenue.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate how users experience the implementation of self-regulation techniques in a Web-based intervention targeting physical activity and sedentary behavior in the general population.
   Methods: In this study, 20 adults from the general population used the intervention for 5 weeks. Users' website data were explored, and semistructured interviews with each of the users were performed. A directed content analysis was performed using NVivo Software.
   Results: The techniques "providing feedback on performance," "action planning," and "prompting review of behavioral goals" were appreciated by users. However, the implementation of " barrier identification/problem solving" appeared to frustrate users; this was also reflected by the users' website data-many coping plans were of poor quality. Most users were well aware of the benefits of adopting a more active way of living and stated not to have learned novel information. However, they appreciated the provided information because it reminded them about the importance of having an active lifestyle. Furthermore, prompting users to self-monitor their behavioral change was not sufficiently stimulating to make users actually monitor their behavior.
   Conclusions: Iteratively involving potential end users offers guidance to optimally adapt the implementation of various behavior change techniques to the target population. We recommend creating short interventions with a straightforward layout that support users in creating and evaluating specific plans for action.

AB The influenza ('flu') vaccination is low cost(1) and effective, typically reducing the likelihood of infection by 50-60%(2). It is recommended for nearly everyone older than 6 months of age(3); yet, only 40% of Americans are immunized each year. Vaccination rates are higher among at-risk groups, such as those >= 65 years of age, but still only 6 in 10 receive it(4). There have been numerous attempts to improve vaccination rates using strategies such as school-based programmes, financial incentives and reminders, but these have generally had limited success(5-7). Of the attempts that are successful, most are expensive-limiting scalability-and have not been evaluated in the elderly(8). Conversely, lower-cost interventions, such as mailed information, hold promise for a scalable solution, but their limited effectiveness may result from how they have been designed. We randomly assigned 228,000 individuals >= 66 years of age to one of five versions of letters intended to motivate vaccination, including versions with an implementation intention prompt and an enhanced active choice implementation prompt. We found that a single mailed letter significantly increased influenza vaccination rates compared with no letter. However, there was no difference in vaccination rates across the four different letters tailored with behavioural science techniques.

AB Electric vehicles are an important instrument to decarbonize transportation, offering a range of co-benefits such as reductions in local pollution, noise emissions, and oil dependency. Unfortunately, price, range, infrastructure and technological uncertainty are only some of the barriers to a faster adoption of these vehicles. To overcome these barriers, there is a broad call for public support and a growing body of primarily survey and choice experiment studies to show which policy mechanisms are effective, with mixed outcomes. In response, this paper offers a qualitative comparative analysis that draws on 227 semi-structured interviews with 257 transportation and electricity experts from 201 institutions across 17 cities within the Nordic region to discuss the reasoning and arguments behind EV incentives and policy mechanisms. A frequency analysis of the most coded responses favoured cost reduction mechanisms, in particular taxation exemptions; infrastructure support for public and apartment charging; the importance of consumer awareness, especially information campaigns; certain other specific policy measures like procurement programs and environmental zones; and more general policy principles. More in-depth, our analysis shows the debates around these mechanisms and how the pros and cons of these mechanisms differ per country, per transport segment, per phase of transition or market share, even per city. In short, this paper calls for strong stable national targets and price incentives combined with local flexibility to implement secondary benefits and more attention to awareness campaigns to advance the implementation of electric vehicles.

TI A web-based education program to encourage organ donation registration

AB Background: The gap between the supply and demand of organ donors is substantial, causing patients to suffer from long waiting times. Moreover, the lack of registrations places a burden on family members and medical professionals when an unregistered individual dies. This article describes a cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) study to assess the effectiveness and quality of implementation of a web-based program aimed at encouraging lower-educated adolescents to register a well-informed choice about organ donation, regardless of it being as a donor or not.
   Methods/design: The program will be delivered by teachers at schools for Intermediate Vocational Education in the Netherlands. The effectiveness will be assessed in a CRCT design with post-test only using self-administered questionnaires for the primary outcome (i.e. intention to register). Classes will be matched to improve equivalence of groups. From each pair of matched classes, one class will be randomly assigned to the experimental condition, and the other assigned to the control condition. Students in the control groups will fill in the questionnaire before receiving the program, while the experimental groups will do this afterwards. A post-test design prevents the risk of testing bias. The required sample size is 14 schools, with 10 classes per school and 13 unregistered students per class. The questionnaire assesses demographics, behavioural determinants (attitude, self-efficacy, knowledge and social outcomes), intention to register (as a donor) and registration status. Six months after delivery, registration status will be assessed again. Additionally, a process evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the quality of implementation using both qualitative (i.e. semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (i.e. logbooks, questionnaires, Google Analytics to track user behaviour at the website) methods.
   Discussion: Findings of the study can help to further improve the program and serve as a basis for a solid dissemination plan. Moreover, the study will provide insight into (change in) determinants of registration and donorship and the translation of research into practice of school-based health promotion interventions, which can serve as an example for others.

AB Background and aims: Although familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can be effectively managed using cholesterol-lowering medication, patients often fall short of complete treatment adherence. Identifying the psychological factors associated with self-regulation of FH medication is important to inform interventions to maximize adherence. The aim of the present study was to test an integrated psychological model in predicting FH patients' intentions to take medication.
   Methods: FH patients attending clinics in seven countries were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey study. Consenting patients (N = 551) completed self-report measures of generalized beliefs about medication overuse and harms, beliefs in treatment effectiveness, specific beliefs about taking medication (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control), and intentions to take medication. Participants also completed measures of demographic variables (age, gender, education level, income, cardiovascular disease status). Data were analysed using path analysis controlling for country and demographic variables.
   Results: Attitudes (b = .331, p < 0.001), subjective norms (b = .121, p = 0.009), and beliefs about medication overuse (beta = .160, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of intentions to take medication. Treatment beliefs predicted intentions indirectly (b = .088, p < 0.001) through attitudes and subjective norms. There was also an indirect effect of beliefs about medication overuse on intentions (b = -.045, p = 0.056), but the effect was small compared with the direct effect.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate the importance among FH patients of specific beliefs about taking medication and generalized beliefs about medication overuse and treatment in predicting medication intentions. When managing patients, clinicians should emphasize the efficacy of taking cholesterol-lowering drugs and the importance of treatment outcomes, and allay concerns about medication overuse.

AB Finding a new job requires individuals to be unruffled and focused despite obstacles, self-control dilemmas between avoiding short-term costs and achieving long-term gains. We propose that distinguishing two types of obstacles helps to understand when job search goal are more likely to be maintained. We propose that emotional obstacles are internal states that redirect energy away from the goal, whereas attentional obstacles are external events and tasks that distract focus from the goal, and emotional skills and situational norms, respectively, determine if the job seeker can resolve the self-control dilemma and overcome these obstacles. An initial study supported the differentiation of emotional (i.e., frustration, fatigue) and attentional (i.e., schoolwork, social events) obstacles among student job seekers, and in another sample of graduating job seekers these two obstacles differentially affected their job search intensity over two weeks. Specifically, emotional obstacles either reduced or increased the hours spent on the job search depending on whether job seekers could effectively regulate their emotions. Attentional obstacles either increased or reduced subsequent hours spent on the job search, depending on awareness of peers' job seeking activities. We build on these findings to make suggestions for future job search motivation research and training interventions.

AB Objectives
   To assess the implementation of the current guideline and identify potential underlying causes for late surgery in children with undescended testis (UDT) in Germany. UDT is the most common surgical issue in paediatric urology and to avoid malignant degeneration and subfertility current guidelines recommend orchidopexy during the first year of life; however, this seems not to be implemented in practice.
   Patients and Methods
   In all, 5 547 patients with cryptorchidism at 16 hospitals nationwide were studied regarding age at orchidopexy between 2003 and 2016. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors influencing timing of surgery. Additionally, a survey on knowledge of UDT management was conducted amongst physicians treating boys and final-year medical students.
   Results
   Between 2003 and 2008 only 4% of boys with UDT underwent surgery before the age of 1 year. After the guideline update from 2009, this figure was 5% from 2010 to 2012, and 8% from 2013 to 2016. The presence of a specialised department for paediatric surgery, as well as a high UDT case-to-year ratio positively influenced the timing of orchidopexy. The survey revealed discipline-specific differences in the levels of knowledge about UDT management. One-third of respondents did not know the guideline recommendations and 61% felt insufficiently informed. International comparisons revealed significant differences in the age at surgery of boys with UDT, with Germany and Great Britain ranging in the middle of the field.
   Conclusions
   Currently, only a small proportion of boys with UDT are operated upon during their first year of life. The level of knowledge in attending physicians remains in need of improvement. This should be actively addressed, i.e. by campaigns and educational programmes. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying causes of late orchidopexy in UDT.

AB Are citizens more likely to vote when they are asked to make plans about how they will cast their ballots? Such planning-typically described as "implementation intentions"-has been shown to increase many types of desirable behaviors, including exercising and healthy eating, receiving vaccinations, physical rehabilitation, and recycling. Important earlier work in political science suggests voter turnout can also be influenced by implementation intention interventions, whereby electors are prompted to "make a plan" to vote (Nickerson & Rogers, 2010), though this finding has gone largely unreplicated. At the same time, elections management bodies (EMBs) in many contexts regularly conduct informational campaigns in the period leading up to elections, though little is known about the effects of such efforts upon turnout. Using data from an online experiment conducted at the time of the 2015 Canadian Federal Election, we demonstrate that implementation intention interventions can improve voter turnout but that this effect is conditional upon electors being exposed to informational materials about how to vote in the election. When survey respondents were provided with information on voting requirements and methods, and then prompted with questions forcing them to contemplate the act of casting their ballots, we observe a sizable increase in turnout rates.

TI When anti-corruption norms lead to undesirable results: learning from
   the Indonesian experience
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes how and why adverse side-effects have occurred in the implementation of two articles of Indonesia's anti-corruption law. These articles prohibit unlawful acts which may be detrimental to the finances of the state. Indeed, the lawmakers had good intentions when they drafted the two articles. They wanted to make it easier to convict corrupt individuals by lowering the standard of evidence required to prove criminal liability. The implementation of these articles has raised legal uncertainty. The loose definition of the elements of the crime enables negligence and imperfection of (public) contracts to be considered as corruption. The Constitutional Court has issued two rulings to restrict and guide the interpretation of these articles. However, law enforcement agencies (Supreme Court and public prosecutors) have been unwilling to adhere to the rulings. There are two possible reasons for this. First, as has been argued by several commentators, the law enforcement agencies have misinterpreted the concept of unlawfulness. Besides, the law enforcement agencies wish to be seen to be committed to prosecuting and delivering convictions in corruption cases. To do so, they need to maintain looser definitions of the elements of the offence. This paper endorses the Constitutional Court rulings and provides additional reasons in support of their stance. The paper can be considered as a case study for other countries that may be contemplating similar legislation.

AB Based on the theory of entrepreneurial human capital, this study employs questionnaires from 730 secondary vocational school students to explore the status quo of entrepreneurship education and the influence of entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial knowledge, and entrepreneurial competence on entrepreneurial intention. The study results prove the following. First, the participation rate of entrepreneurship education in secondary vocational schools is much higher than in their counterpart (academic schools), with more than half of secondary vocational students reporting having received entrepreneurship education of diverse types. Second, students evaluated themselves with relatively high entrepreneurial competence and intention, although they answered "unclear" to entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurship education. Third, motivation and leadership, as well as enterprise knowledge, play mediating roles through which entrepreneurship education affects entrepreneurial intention, and represent two types of entrepreneurial human capital-entrepreneurial knowledge and entrepreneurial competence. The implications of effective educational implementation are discussed.

AB Aims and objectivesTo explore the impact of an initiative to add unregulated nursing support workers to wards in acute care hospitals.
   BackgroundAdding nursing support workers to existing nurse staffing may be one solution to reduce nursing workloads and improve outcomes. However, the effects of this addition on nurse, patient and system outcomes are not well documented. In one state of Australia, a trial deployment of nursing support workers to wards across the public health system provided opportunity for the exploration of their impact in a natural, real-world, environment.
   DesignCross-sectional study.
   MethodsA sample of five wards where nursing support workers had been added matched to a group of five wards where there were no nursing support workers. Data were collected via patient survey (n=141) and nurse survey (n=154). Analysis was comparative with regression models constructed for the different ward types.
   ResultsNursing leadership, staffing and resources, and nurse experience were linked to outcomes on both ward types. Instability was a significant predictor of reduced quality of care and increased turnover intention on wards where support workers were added.
   ConclusionAdding nursing support workers to ward staffing did not lead to improvements in patient care. Findings suggest that staffing a nursing ward is a complex activity and that a simple approach to staffing is unlikely to be successful. Future research should explore the process of implementation and the conditions under which this strategy is likely to be successful.
   Relevance to clinical practiceWard-level factors are key in making appropriate staffing and skill mix choices to limit instability and to consequently avoid negative patient, staff and system outcomes. Consideration of the ward context, alongside effective delegation processes and integration into the care team are imperative when adding nursing support workers.

AB ObjectivePeople can use inhibitory control to temporarily inhibit their personal preferences to achieve their long-term goals. According to the ego fixation model (Koole et al., 2014), ruminators have difficulties relaxing inhibitory control, leading them to continue inhibiting their personal needs, even when this is no longer required by the situation. Inhibitory control may thus disrupt healthy appetite regulation among ruminators.
   MethodAmong 324 Dutch undergraduate students (218 women; M-age=21.5), different inhibitory control states were manipulated by varying whether or not participants exerted inhibitory control (Study 1) or priming high versus low inhibitory control (Study 2). All participants then performed a food-tasting task. Healthy appetite regulation was defined as a positive correlation between level of food deprivation and preference for high-calorie foods.
   ResultsFor taste ratings, the interaction between inhibitory control and rumination was significant in each study: Inhibitory control disrupted healthy appetite regulation in taste preferences among ruminators, but not among non-ruminators. For eating behavior, the same interaction effect was significant when the two studies were combined.
   ConclusionsInhibitory control disrupts healthy appetite regulation among ruminators. These findings suggest the need for caution in interventions that rely on inhibitory control, especially among samples with compulsive thought tendencies.

AB Although dual-process or divided-mind models of self-control dominate the literature, they suffer from empirical and conceptual challenges. We propose an alternative approach, suggesting that self-control can be characterized by a fragmented part versus integrated whole dynamic. Whereas responses to events derived from fragmented parts of the mind undermine self-control, responses to events derived from integrated wholes enhance self-control. We review empirical evidence from psychology and related disciplines that support this model. We, moreover, discuss the implications of this work for psychology, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy. In particular, we highlight how this model addresses many of the conceptual and empirical short-comings of divided-mind models. We suggest that understanding self-control as the interplay between fragmented parts versus integrated wholes, moreover, provides novel insights and testable new hypotheses.

   IMPACT
AB This paper reports the effectiveness of a Midwest state university's "100% tobacco-free" policy. The policy used social pressures and punishments to incentivize tobacco users to no longer consume tobacco on campus. The policy had three distinct periods (Pre-Promotion, Post-Promotion, and Post-Policy). Social pressures and punishments were introduced during the Post-Promotion and Post-Policy periods, respectively. Changes in cigarette consumption were inferred by counting the number of cigarette butts found at various locations on campus. A statistically significant decrease in the number of cigarette butts was observed during the Post-Promotion period. After the initial drop, tobacco use remained constant for the remainder of the period. An additional decrease was observed once punishments were introduced in the third period However, the number of cigarette butts observed on campus remained significantly above zero. Further research is needed to understand how smokers substitute across time, location, and tobacco products after the implementation of similar policies.

AB Standard community-engaged research methods involve reporting research findings back to study participants. Project HEAL is an implementation trial conducted in 14 African American churches. This paper reports on a strengths-based approach to reporting Project HEAL organizational capacity data back to church leadership, through use of individualized church reports. Pastors in each church completed a church organizational capacity assessment. The study team, including community partners representing church leadership, co-created a channel and content to disseminate the capacity data back to Project HEAL church leaders. This consisted of a 4-page lay report that included the church's capacity scores, and recommendations for future evidence-based health promotion programming matched to their capacity. The study team was able to meet with nine of the 14 churches to review the report, which took an average of six and a half weeks to schedule. The individualized church reports were well-received by pastors, who expressed an intention to share the information with others in the church and to sustain health promotion activities in their organizations. Though the individualized reports were embraced by the pastors, it is unknown whether this process will result in sustainable health promotion in these organizations without further follow-up.

SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; T-TEST; CURRICULUM; EDUCATION
AB Commonly adopted engineering pedagogy tends to be lecture based, and places students in a passive and often secondary role in the classroom. Research in the field of engineering education highlights the ineffectiveness of such strategies and advocates adopting strategies that actively engage learners. Various pedagogical techniques promote student engagement; this paper focuses on two specific techniques: problem-based learning (PBL) and vertical integration. The authors created engaging classroom environments through vertically integrated courses that implemented PBL through shared course projects. Specifically, the authors created a framework for pairing two different student bodies across two disciplines, integrating a graduate civil engineering course (32 students) and an undergraduate construction management course (22 students). Implementation of the Spring 2016 framework improves student performance on course projects and students' self-reported professional skill level and confidence in said skills, developed in part through participation in the framework. Further, the framework has a positive impact on undergraduate students' intention to stay in their major and both student bodies report more interest in completing an additional advanced degree after participating in the vertically integrated courses. Finally, students report that the experience teaches professional skills they expect will be required in their own future careers. It is notable that undergraduates recognized more benefits of this implementation, especially that they have more potential for improvement than advanced graduate students. This paper contributes to the engineering education body of knowledge by delivering a proof of concept that PBL through vertical integration of different disciplines across undergraduate and graduate students supports improved performance and encourages professional skill development and confidence. The paper presents the framework itself, as well as evaluative results from framework implementation.

   CONTEXT
AB Context: Critical infrastructures (CIs) are mission-critical, large-scale systems that provide essential products and services for everyday life. Modeling and simulation (M&S) technique is one of useful methods for understanding the complex and emergent behavior of CIs. However, the several characteristics of CIs, such as interdependence, adaptability, dependability, etc., can disturb modelers' activities to develop the quality models for CIs. The quality of these models can affect the reliability of simulation results as well as the reusability of the models in further simulations.
   Objective: In this paper, we propose a M&S methodology that aims to improve the quality of CI models by means of focusing on dependability, which is one of important characteristics of CIs.
   Method: First, we propose a system to model and simulate CIs based on discrete event system specification, a belief-desire-intention model, and a role-oriented command hierarchy model. Next, we integrate several modeling methods, such as goal modeling, agent-based modeling, and object-oriented modeling, into a unified M&S methodology (UMAS) to seamlessly develop CI models from initial requirements to final modeling artifacts. Finally, we propose a dependability-enhanced UMAS (DUMAS) that can deal with the dependability of CI models.
   Results: In our case study of applying the DUMAS into the M&S of a smart grid, we show how the DUMAS reflects the characteristics of CIs on the overall modeling artifacts.
   Conclusion: The DUMAS provides a novel method that can improve the quality of CI models through elaborating on the activities of requirements engineering with regard to the dependability of CIs. Therefore, modelers can systematically develop quality models from requirements analysis to implementation in compliance with the DUMAS.

AB Background
   Partnerships in global health and development governance have been firmly established as a tool to achieve effective outcomes. Botswana implements Safe Male Circumcision (SMC) for HIV prevention through a North-South partnership comprising the local Ministry of Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (funded by PEPFAR) and Africa Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). The SMC partnership experienced significant antagony and the aim of this paper is to illuminate the actions and processes in the SMC program that contributed to that antagony.
   Methods
   Methods used to gather data include observation of the partners' planning and strategic meeting in 2012, in-depth interviews with lead officers at national level, focus group discussions with district officers and implementers, younger male officers and old community members as recipients of the service.
   Results
   The findings reveal that the partnership experienced antagony during operational processes and as the ultimate outcome. Target setting, financial power of the North, superficial ownership given to the South, ignoring local traditional realities results in antagony. Three roots of antagony have been identified: 1. therapeutic domination - medical expertise given with arrogance; 2. iatrogenic violence - good intentions that cause unintended harm; 3. the Trojan horse - Reckless acceptance of the gift as well as deceptive power positioned under the pretext of benevolence.
   Conclusion
   The three roots of antagony; therapeutic domination, iatrogenic violence and the Trojan horse, constitute attitudes, hidden intentions and unintended consequences that influence program implementation and cause harm at different levels. Examples of therapeutic domination and the Trojan horse have highlighted the need for vigilance at the stage of establishing a partnership, to prevent more powerful partners from developing and applying hidden agendas and to strengthen accountability from the local partner. Iatrogenic violence has highlighted the need for partnership interventions to prevent good partner intentions accidentally producing bad outcomes.

AB Background: Health systems globally are under pressure to ensure value for money, and the people working within the system determine the extent and nature of health services provided. A performance assessment (PA); an important component of a performance management system (PMS) is deemed important at improving the performance of human resources for health. An effective PA motivates and improves staff engagement in their work The aim of this paper is to describe the experiences of implementing a PA practice at a district in South Africa. It highlights factors that undermine the intention of the process and reflects on factors that can enable implementation to improve the staff performance for an effective and efficient district health service.
   Methods: Data was collected through in-depth interviews, observations and reflective engagements with managers at a district in one of the Provinces in South Africa. The study examined the managers' experiences of implementing the PA at the district level.
   Results: Findings illuminate that a range of factors influence the implementation of the PA system. Most of it is attributed to context and organizational culture including management and leadership capacity. The dominance of autocratic approaches influence management and supervision of front-line managers. Management and leadership capacity is constrained by factors such as insufficient management skills due to lack of training. The established practice of recruiting from local communities facilitates patronage - compromising supervisor-subordinate relationships. In addition, organizational constraints and the constant policy changes and demands have compromised the implementation of the overall Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) - indirectly affecting the assessment component.
   Conclusion: To strengthen district health services, there should be improvement of processes that enhance the performance of the health system. Implementation of the PA system relies on the extent of management skills at the local level. There is a need to develop managers who have the ability to manage in a transforming and complex environment. This means developing both hard skills such as planning, co-ordination and monitoring and soft skills where one is able to focus on relationships and communication, therefore allowing collaborative and shared management as opposed to authoritarian approaches.

AB Background: Many registered nurses (RNs) increased their participation in the New Zealand health workforce during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), resulting in low vacancy rates. However, based on the documented impact of improving economies, a mean RN age of about 50, and just-agreed substantive increases in RN pay rates, it is likely that many will soon leave or reduce the hours they work. This study aims to investigate whether improved financial security will encourage RNs to leave or reduce their work commitment and to identify the factors that influence such intentions.
   Methods: An exploratory study using a cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected in 2014-2015 via an e-survey of 2,910 RNs in New Zealand. Data were analysed by regression.
   Results: We found that due to "burnout" and low "work engagement", both of which are strongly affected by workload and work-life interference, 22.6% of the RNs surveyed plan to leave work altogether and a further 32% plan to reduce their workforce participation when their financial situations improve.
   Conclusions: The findings justify the urgent cooperative development, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive suite of RN 'retention' measures involving national nursing organisations, the RN regulator and health system employers and funders.

AB The Model Agricultural Produce Marketing Act (APMC Act), 2003, and recent improvements to it through Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitating) Act (APLM), 2017, provide some hope in increasing efficiency in agricultural markets in India. The Model APLM Act advocates increased competition in the marketplace by allowing private markets, farmers' markets, and electronic-National Agricultural Markets (eNAM). Under eNAM, the Central Government introduced electronic trading in about 400 APMC markets in 2016 and connected them through uniform market platform in line with the e-markets of Karnataka introduced in 2012. This article examines experience of e-markets in Karnataka since 2012, with the intention to suggest improvements to eNAM. Results show that e-markets help increase competition, eliminate collusion among traders resulting in increased farmers' price and market arrivals. They facilitate competitive bidding and same day payments to farmers. However, there was some resistance from traders and commission agents as they felt that there were no benefits in e-auction compared to physical transactions. In addition, there was fear of taxation of on-line transactions. Aligning interests of all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and commission agents is the biggest hurdle in the implementation of eNAM.

AB Background The Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of Angiox (MATRIX) programme was designed to assess the comparative safety and effectiveness of radial versus femoral access and of bivalirudin versus unfractionated heparin with optional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with the whole spectrum of acute coronary syndrome undergoing invasive management. Here we describe the prespecified final 1-year outcomes of the entire programme.
   Methods MATRIX was a programme of three nested, randomised, multicentre, open-label, superiority trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome in 78 hospitals in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were simultaneously randomly assigned (1:1) before coronary angiography to radial or femoral access and to bivalirudin, with or without post-percutaneous coronary intervention infusion or unfractionated heparin (one-step inclusion). Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome were randomly assigned (1:1) before coronary angiography to radial or femoral access and, only if deemed eligible to percutaneous coronary intervention after angiography (two-step inclusion), entered the antithrombin type and treatment duration programmes. Randomisation sequences were computer generated, blocked, and stratified by intended new or current use of P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel vs ticagrelor or prasugrel), and acute coronary syndrome type (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, troponin-positive, or troponin-negative non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome). Bivalirudin was given as a bolus of 0.75 mg/kg, followed immediately by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg per h until completion of percutaneous coronary intervention. Heparin was given at 70-100 units per kg in patients not receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and at 50-70 units per kg in patients receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Clinical follow-up was done at 30 days and 1 year. Co-primary outcomes for MATRIX access and MATRIX antithrombin type were major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to 30 days; and net adverse clinical events, defined as the composite of non-coronary artery bypass graft-related major bleeding, or major adverse cardiovascular events up to 30 days. The primary outcome for MATRIX treatment duration was the composite of urgent target vessel revascularisation, definite stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events up to 30 days. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle.
   Findings Between Oct 11,2011, and Nov 7,2014, we randomly assigned 8404 patients to receive radial (4197 patients) or femoral (4207 patients) access. Of these 8404 patients, 7213 were included in the MATRIX antithrombin type study and were randomly assigned to bivalirudin (3610 patients) or heparin (3603 patients). Patients assigned to bivalirudin were included in the MATRIX treatment duration study, and were randomly assigned to post-procedure infusion (1799 patients) or no post-procedure infusion (1811 patients). At 1 year, major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ between patients assigned to radial access compared with those assigned to femoral access (14.2% vs 15.7%; rate ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-1.00; p=0.0526), but net adverse clinical events were fewer with radial than with femoral access (15.2% vs 17.2%; 0.87,0.78-0.97; p=0.0128). Compared with heparin, bivalirudin was not associated with fewer major adverse cardiovascular (15.8% vs 16.8%; 0.94,0.83-1.05; 13=0.28) or net adverse clinical events (17.0% vs 18.4%; 0.91,0.81-1.02; p=0.10). The composite of urgent target vessel revascularisation, stent thrombosis, or net adverse clinical events did not differ with or without post-procedure bivalirudin infusion (17.4% vs 17.4%; 0.99,0.84-1.16; p=0.90).
   Interpretation In patients with acute coronary syndrome, radial access was associated with lower rates of net adverse clinical events compared with femoral access, but not major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year. Bivalirudin with or without post-procedure infusion was not associated with lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events or net adverse clinical events. Radial access should become the default approach in acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing invasive management.

AB Background
   Three main activity patterns have been distinguished in describing chronic pain (avoidance, pacing and persistence). However, their influence on patient outcomes remains a question of debate. This observational study aimed to measure the associations between the avoidance, pacing, and persistence (labelled overdoing) scales of the Patterns of Activity Measure-Pain (POAM-P), self-reported outcomes (pain-interference, depression, functional ability), and observational outcomes (walking, lifting test, physical fitness).
   Methods
   We conducted an observational study with cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The data were collected prospectively before and after treatment, which was a 5-week functional rehabilitation including vocational aspects. In addition to self-reported and observational outcomes, patients were asked if they thought they would be able to return to work at 6 months. Analyses were conducted with treatment effect sizes, correlations, and multiple regression models.
   Results
   In this sample (891 patients), we found on average small to moderate improvements for pain-interference and observational outcomes (Cohen's d: 0.37 to 0.64). According to the multivariable models, overdoing was associated with most of the beneficial psychosocial and observational outcomes (beta-0.13 to 0.17; all p<0.01). Avoidance was related to negative psychosocial outcomes before treatment (beta-0.09 to 0.17; all p<0.015). Pacing, which had moderate correlation with avoidance (r = 0.46), was not associated with most of the outcomes. The feeling that the goal of returning to work was attainable was associated with lower avoidance scores (adjusted OR 0.97; p = 0.024).
   Conclusions
   The overdoing POAM-P scale probably measures a task-contingent persistence, which appears appropriate in the setting of this study. Persistent behavior was indeed related to small or moderate positive biopsychosocial outcomes, before and after treatment. Moreover feeling able to return to work was related to lower avoidance. Further studies should test the efficacy of motivational strategies that may promote functional task-contingent persistence and reduce avoidance of painful tasks.

   IMPLEMENTATION; COMPETENCES; DIRECTORS; PROGRAM; SCHOOLS; CAM
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite widespread patient use, herbal and dietary supplement education is not required in US-accredited medical schools. Thus, physicians are unprepared to address supplement use with patients. Our objectives were to assess perceived adequacy of medical education on supplements, determine resident perspectives on appropriate placement of curricula in their longitudinal medical education, and evaluate the effects of an innovative workshop on family medicine resident knowledge about supplements and intentions to address this topic with patients.
   METHODS: Family medicine residents (N=65) participated in an hour-long workshop covering basic concepts about herbal and dietary supplements, including regulations, literature review techniques, and risk/benefit analysis. The participants completed pre/postworkshop surveys to assess need for increased education and evaluate efficacy of the workshop.
   RESULTS: Most participants (91.9%) thought they should have received more education than provided on supplements and perceived greater need for curricula in undergraduate medical education than in graduate medical education. Only 47.6% received required education on supplements, significantly less than the 72.6% who thought this education should be required (P<0.05). The workshop increased the proportion of residents planning to address patients' supplement use, increased the frequency residents intend to ask about supplements, and improved resident perceptions of the efficacy of some supplements when used with physician guidance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Residents perceived a lack of adequate medical education on the use of herbal and dietary supplements. Results showed a brief workshop increased resident intentions to discuss supplement use with patients. Further education on supplement use may be warranted.

TI Assessing the Effectiveness of Pay-to-Go Policies: Evidence from Spain's
   Voluntary Return Program(1)
SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Pay-to-go programs are incentive-based policies implemented by immigrant-receiving nations with the intention of enticing migrants home. Spain introduced such a program following its recent economic downturn. We assess its effectiveness using a difference-in-differences methodology. We test if the policy lowered the unemployment likelihood of eligible migrants by comparing changes in their propensity to be unemployed from before to after program implementation to changes experienced by similar non-eligible migrants. The Spanish pay-to-go policy did not entice immigrants to return home, except among Latin Americans, who enjoyed statistically and economically significant reductions in their unemployment likelihood following program implementation.

AB A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that provides a new communication path for people with disabilities to communicate with the outside world. Recently, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI system has received more attention because it has a higher information transfer rate (ITR) and requires less user and system training. SSVEP is a periodic signal that generated by a periodic visual stimulation and its frequency spectrum contains stimulation frequency and its harmonics. The aim of the SSVEP based BCI system is to detect the stimulation frequency and thus understand the intention of the person. In recent years, various methods have been proposed for SSVEP recognition. Among these methods, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) as a well-known powerful method and multivariate linear regression (MLR) as a state-of-the-art method can be mentioned. Although these methods find the dominant frequency in the short time EEG signal, their performance severely degraded by the presence of the noise. Therefore, the appropriate removal of the background EEG signal, that plays the role of the noise, is essential. In this paper, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is used as a preprocessing method for separating random and periodic components of the recorded EEG signal. Also, the skewness coefficient and the Spearman correlation are used to optimize the values of SSA parameters. The experimental results show a significant improvement in performance after preprocessing by SSA using CCA and MLR methods, especially for short data lengths. Also, it has been shown that SSA with the optimal parameters (OSSA) has a higher performance than SSA with fixed parameters. The superiority of proposed method suggests it as an appropriate choice for implementation of the real-time SSVEP based BCI system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ant Forest is an emerging mobile application platform that engages people in environment-friendly behavior with fragmented time and helps them cultivate ecological awareness and habit. Users grow virtual trees on the platform with the energy saved from daily low-carbon activities, and Ant Forest plants real saplings in desertified areas when the trees become big enough. Facilitating the public's participation in such green welfare, Ant Forest is a new-generation persuasive system with functions like social media and gamification. In addition to perceived persuasiveness in the existing literature, this study includes sense of achievement and perceived entertainment as extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, respectively, to explain people's continuous use of such a system and consequent behavior change. The results of a survey suggest that primary task support, perceived credibility, and perceived social support associated with Ant Forest positively affect the user's continuance intention through the mediation of perceived persuasiveness, sense of achievement, and perceiving entertaining. Furthermore, perceived persuasiveness and continuance intention lead to ultimate behavior change. The findings suggest the importance of both persuasive and motivational considerations in the implementation of new-generation persuasive systems to make them effective in the long run.

AB Propensity to plan is an indicator of financial capability that contributes to consumer financial well-being. Previous research has shown that propensity to plan is positively related to objective financial well-being but little research was found to examine its association with subjective financial well-being. Using financial satisfaction to measure subjective financial well-being, this study addressed this research gap and had three objectives: (1) to explore factors associated with propensity to plan, (2) to examine the association between propensity to plan and financial capability factors, and (3) to examine the association between propensity to plan and financial satisfaction. Using data from the 2015 US National Financial Capability Study, the results showed socioeconomic differences in propensity to plan. The results suggest consumers with more economic resources had higher scores in propensity to plan. In addition, propensity to plan was positively associated with financial capability factors, suggesting financial planning is a desirable financial behavior. Finally, propensity to plan made unique contributions to financial satisfaction after controlling for socioeconomic and other financial capability factors.

AB Background: Self-reported alcohol misuse remains high in armed forces personnel even after they have left service. More than 50% of ex-serving personnel meet the criteria for hazardous alcohol use; however, many fail to acknowledge that they have a problem. Previous research indicates that interventions delivered via smartphone apps are suitable in promoting self-monitoring of alcohol use, have a broad reach, and may be more cost-effective than other types of brief interventions. There is currently no such intervention specifically designed for the armed forces.
   Objective: This study sought to describe the development of a tailored smartphone app and personalized text messaging (short message service, SMS) framework and to test the usability and feasibility (measured and reported as user engagement) of this app in a hard-to-engage ex-serving population.
   Methods: App development used Agile methodology (an incremental, iterative approach used in software development) and was informed by behavior change theory, participant feedback, and focus groups. Participants were recruited between May 2017 and June 2017 from an existing United Kingdom longitudinal military health and well-being cohort study, prescreened for eligibility, and directed to download either Android or iOS versions of the "Information about Drinking for Ex-serving personnel" (InDEx) app. Through the app, participants were asked to record alcohol consumption, complete a range of self-report measures, and set goals using implementation intentions (if-then plans). Alongside the app, participants received daily automated personalized text messages (SMS) corresponding to specific behavior change techniques with content informed by the health action process approach with the intended purpose of promoting the use of the drinks diary, suggesting alternative behaviors, and providing feedback on goals setting.
   Results: Invitations to take part in the study were sent to ex-serving personnel, 22.6% (31/137) of whom accepted and downloaded the app. Participants opened the InDEx app a median of 15.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 8.5-19.0) times during the 4 week period (28 days), received an average of 36.1 (SD 3.2) text messages (SMS), consumed alcohol on a median of 13.0 (IQR 11.0-15.0) days, and consumed a median of 5.6 (IQR 3.3-11.8) units per drinking day in the first week, which decreased to 4.7 (IQR 2.0-6.9) units by the last week and remained active for 4.0 (IQR 3.0-4.0) weeks.
   Conclusions: Personnel engaged and used the app regularly as demonstrated by the number of initializations, interactions, and time spent using InDEx. Future research is needed to evaluate the engagement with and efficacy of InDEx for the reduction of alcohol consumption and binge drinking in an armed forces population.

AB The Safety Pharmacology Society organized a scientific session at its annual conference in 2017 to discuss the challenges and opportunities of the Comprehensive In-Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) paradigm. Our intention was to raise awareness of this initiative with its members and also to gauge the extent to which safety pharmacologists have incorporated the CiPA testing strategy within the pharmaceutical industry. CiPA offers many potential opportunities including 1) a focus on proarrhythmic risk (as opposed to QTc prolongation), 2) providing scientific rationale to support the continued development of compounds that may have a poor selectivity over hERG whilst also blocking other inward currents and 3) reducing the extent of ECG monitoring in clinical trials with a greater influence of the non-clinical studies. Such opportunities may speed drug development and reduce costs. However, there are also challenges for CiPA implementation. For example, the mixed ion channel paradigm does not easily lend itself to a prospective drug discovery strategy although testing for such effects can be achieved with assays with good throughput. However, it should also be recognized that compounds with a mixed ion channel profile might also have properties that are undesirable to treat non-life threatening indications. All components of CiPA (nonclinical and clinical) require validation, particularly as a composite package to impact drug development and evaluation. One of the significant discussion points was that the existing regulatory guidance supports the use of components of CiPA through follow-up studies. A survey of the conference audience showed that the level of awareness of CiPA is quite high and that companies are already conducting some testing against a wider panel of cardiac ion channels beyond hERG. However, the adoption of other technologies (stem cell derived cardiac myocytes and in silico modeling) is less well developed. Taken together, the session demonstrated the potential advantages of CiPA, but also some significant challenges.

AB Background The incidence of benign and malignant testicular disorders is on the rise. Three literature reviews and one qualitative study found that men's awareness of testicular disorders was lacking, and their intentions to seek help for symptoms of testicular disease were low.
   Objectives The aim of the study was to enhance men's awareness of testicular disorders, help-seeking intentions for testicular symptoms, and intention and behavior to feel their testes.
   Methods Men aged 18-50 years were recruited from a university and asked to engage in a three-level, educational, virtual reality experience. The Medical Research Council framework guided the development and pilot testing of the intervention. Knowledge, awareness, perceived risk, implementation intentions, help-seeking intentions, and behaviors were measured at pretest (T0), immediately posttest (T1), and 1 month posttest (T2).
   Results Data were available from 49 participants. In comparison to T0, a significant increase in knowledge (mean difference [MD] = 3.5, 95% CI [2.8, 4.26]); testicular awareness (MD = 0.2, 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]); implementation intentions (MD = 0.6, 95% CI [0.33, 0.90]); and help-seeking intentions for testicular swelling (MD = 0.3, 95% CI [0.12, 0.51]), lumpiness (MD = 0.3, 95% CI [0.08, 0.46]), and pain (MD = 0.6, 95% CI [0.25, 1.01]) was noted at T1. This increase was maintained at T2. Participants who expressed an intention to feel their testes at T0 were more likely to report performing this behavior at T2.
   Discussion The intervention succeeded in promoting knowledge, testicular awareness, implementation intentions, help-seeking intentions, and behaviors. A randomized controlled trial of the Enhancing Men's Awareness of Testicular Disorders intervention with a larger sample size is warranted.

AB Resistant avoidance behaviors play a crucial role in the maintenance of anxiety disorders and are therefore central targets of therapeutic interventions. In the present study, the development of avoidance behavior was investigated in 24 healthy participants who repeatedly prematurely terminated the exposure to increasing interoceptive threat, i.e., the feeling of dyspnea induced by increasing inspiratory resistive loads that were followed by the ultimate threat, a short breathing occlusion. Physiological responses and subjective anxiety preceding terminations were compared to matched intervals of a matched control group (N = 24) who completed the exposure. Initially, participants terminated during the ultimate threat, i.e., during occlusion. This first termination was preceded by a strong surge in autonomic arousal and reported anxiety. Startle reflex and the P3 component of event-related brain potentials to startle probes were strongly inhibited, indicating preparation for defensive action. With repetitive terminations, individuals successively terminated earlier, avoiding exposure to the occlusion. This avoidant behavior was accompanied by alleviated autonomic arousal as compared to the first termination. In addition, no indication of physiological response preparation was found implying that the avoidance behavior was performed in a rather habitual way. Matched controls did not show any indication of a defensive response surge in the matched intervals. In matched controls, no changes in physiological response patterns were detected while anxiety levels increased with repetitions. The present results shed new light on our understanding of the motivational basis of avoidance behavior and may help to refine etiological models, behavioral analysis and therapeutic strategies in treating anxiety disorders.

AB PurposeIn the clinic, computed tomography (CT) has evolved into an essential modality for diagnostic imaging by multidetector row CT (MDCT) and image guided intervention by cone beam CT (CBCT). Recognizing the increasing importance of axial MDCT/CBCT in clinical and preclinical applications, and the existence of CB artifacts in MDCT/CBCT images, we provide a review of CB artifacts' root causes, rendering mechanisms and morphology, and possible solutions for elimination and/or reduction of the artifacts.
   MethodsBy examining the null space in Radon and Fourier domain, the root cause of CB artifacts (i.e., data insufficiency) in axial MDCT/CBCT is analytically investigated, followed by a review of the data sufficiency conditions and the circle + source trajectories. The rendering mechanisms and morphology of CB artifacts in axial MDCT/CBCT and their special cases (e.g., half/short scan and full scan with latitudinally displaced detector) are then analyzed, followed by a survey of the potential solutions to suppress the artifacts. The phenomenon of imaged zone indention and its variation over FBP, BPF/DBPF, two-pass and iterative CB reconstruction algorithms and/or schemes are discussed in detail.
   ResultsAn interdomain examination of the null space provides an insightful understanding of the root cause of CB artifacts in axial MDCT/CBCT. The decomposition of CB artifacts rendering mechanisms facilitates understanding of the artifacts' behavior under different conditions and the potential solutions to suppress them. An inspection of the imaged zone intention phenomenon provides guidance on the design and implementation of CB image reconstruction algorithms and schemes for CB artifacts suppression in axial MDCT/CBCT.
   ConclusionsWith increasing importance of axial MDCT/CBCT in clinical and preclinical applications, this review article can update the community with in-depth information and clarification on the latest progress in dealing with CB artifacts and thus increase clinical/preclinical confidence.

AB Tenofovir is less toxic than other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors used in antiretroviral therapy (ART) and may improve retention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on ART. We assessed the impact of national guideline changes in South Africa (2010) and Zambia (2007) recommending tenofovir for first-line ART. We applied regression discontinuity in a prospective cohort study of 52,294 HIV-infected adults initiating first-line ART within 12 months (+/- 12 months) of each guideline change. We compared outcomes in patients presenting just before and after the guideline changes using local linear regression and estimated intention-to-treat effects on initiation of tenofovir, retention in care, and other treatment outcomes at 24 months. We assessed complier causal effects among patients starting tenofovir. The new guidelines increased the percentages of patients initiating tenofovir in South Africa (risk difference (RD) = 81 percentage points, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 73, 89) and Zambia (RD = 42 percentage points, 95% CI: 38, 45). With the guideline change, the percentage of single-drug substitutions decreased substantially in South Africa (RD = -15 percentage points, 95% Cl: -18, -12). Starting tenofovir also reduced attrition in Zambia (intent-to-treat RD = -1.8% (95% Cl: -3.5, -0.1); complier relative risk = 0.74) but not in South Africa (RD = -0.9% (95% Cl: -5.9, 4.1); complier relative risk = 0.94). These results highlight the importance of reducing side effects for increasing retention in care, as well as the differences in population impact of policies with heterogeneous treatment effects implemented in different contexts.

AB Better Beginnings, Better Futures is an evidence-based early childhood initiative that promotes the healthy development of children and families in economically disadvantaged communities. The Better Beginnings model involves the development of community-driven programs through resident involvement that are integrated with existing services, universally accessible to all children and families in a community, focused on prevention, and ecological in nature. In this paper, we describe a pan-Canadian knowledge transfer strategy involving attendance at workshops designed to build the capacity of participants to develop Better Beginnings initiatives in their own communities, and the impacts of the workshops on participants. Process evaluation data were obtained from participants in each Canadian province and territory immediately following the workshops (k=12, N=271). In addition, a smaller sample (n=54) completed a follow-up telephone interview 3months later. All components of the knowledge transfer strategy were well-received and rated highly by participants. Workshop participants indicated increased knowledge of the Better Beginnings model and high levels of satisfaction with the workshop. In the follow-up evaluation, participants indicated strong intentions to use the information they had learned about Better Beginnings to advance the well-being of children and families in their community. We discuss the lessons learned from the knowledge transfer initiative and provide recommendations for advancing knowledge transfer of programs for children and families in context.

AB We propose a computational model that endows conversational agents with the capability to coordinate their speaking turns (turn-taking management) in the context of mixed-initiative two-party dialogs. In human conversations, participants are continuously adjusting their verbal and non-verbal productions for ensuring the effective coordination of speaking turns. In our model, the decision making is a continuous process based on the intrinsic current goal of the agent with respect to turn-taking, namely its motivation to keep-or to leave-its current role (speaker or listener), and on its perception of the intentions of its partner. Concurrently, the agent is also producing signals indicating its willingness to maintain or leave its current role. Our model is based on two models from cognitive psychology: the drift-diffusion model and the theory of behavioral dynamics. After presenting simulations showing how our model makes the coordination emerge from the interactions, we propose a SAIBA-Compliant architecture, named BeAware, created to support the implementation of our model. Finally, using our model, we investigate how an agent's turn-taking strategy may impact the user's experience and the effectiveness of the coordination.

DE Bus bunching; Transit operations; Approximate dynamic programming;

ID HOLDING PROBLEM; TIME; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB Bus headways are typically susceptible to external disturbances (e.g., due to traffic congestion, clustered passenger arrivals, and special passenger needs), which create gaps in the system that grow eventually into bunching. Although many control strategies, such as static and dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of standby buses.

AB Objective The main objective of the present trial was to evaluate the efficiency of a preventative multicomponent prospective memory training among healthy older adults.
   Design This study was a two-arm within-participants trial with 4- and 12-wk follow-ups. Allocation ratio was 1:1, and pretraining and posttraining measurements were included. A total number of 25 healthy older adults were enrolled (mean = 63.32, SD = 4.44). Participants were randomly allocated into two conditions: (a) prospective memory training: participants underwent a multicomponent prospective memory training, and (b) control: participants were not contacted during the training phase. After the training phase was finished, participants crossed over to undergo the condition they did not experience before. The differences between pretraining and posttraining measures of prospective memory, activities of daily living, negative mood (depression), and anxiety were assessed. All changes in the measurements were analyzed using general linear method. This trial is registered at https://www.isrctn.com (#ISRCTN57600070).
   Results Multicomponent prospective memory training program was significantly effective on both subjective and objective prospective memory performances among healthy older adults. Moreover, the training had significant positive effects on activities of daily living (independence) among participants. In addition, negative mood and anxiety levels were reduced after the training was finished.
   Conclusions This multicomponent prospective memory training improved prospective memory performance and activities of daily living and reduce negative mood (depression) and anxiety levels among healthy older adults.

TI Framing corruption: how language affects norms
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study deals with the fairly unexplored relationship between political decision-making and political framing. The intention is to figure out if there is a connection between the way political actors frame corruption and their commitment to the legislative fight against corruption in Austria. Thus, two research questions are focused: Are corruption-related framing practices of political actors of the Austrian National Council predominantly structural or personal? Do these framing strategies affect political actor's willingness to legislatively combat corruption? Therefore the methodological approach is based on a manual dimension-reduced coding process and a further framing analysis of nine years (from 2007 to 2015) of political communication referring to corruption in the Austrian National Council. The framing analysis shows that the perception of corruption as an individual misconduct and a weakness of character of single and collective actors (parties) has significant impacts on anti-corruption policies and leads to an insufficient implementation of anti-corruption measures as well as the obstruction of meaningful policy reforms.

TI Using Implementation Intentions to Prevent Relapse after Psychological
   Treatment for Depression - the SMArT Intervention
SO BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY
LA English
DT Article
DE depression; self-management; relapse prevention; implementation
   intentions
AB Background: It is recognized that a significant proportion of people with depression are prone to relapse, even after successful treatment, and that self-management interventions should be developed and provided. There is evidence that implementation intentions (IMPS) can be successfully applied to health-related behaviours but their application to self-management of mental health problems has been limited. Aims: This paper describes the design and initial evaluation of a Self-Management After Therapy (SMArT) intervention, which incorporated IMPS and followed psychological therapy for depression. We sought to assess the feasibility and acceptability of SMArT. Method: The SMArT intervention was designed with reference to the MRC guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions and co-designed with and implemented in a UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service. Eleven patients who were in remission following treatment for depression received the SMArT intervention, provided by Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs). The evaluation used routine IAPT outcome measures at each session, feedback from patients and PWPs, and analysis of the type of IMPS identified and their fidelity with the model. Six patients provided brief feedback about the intervention to an independent researcher. Results: Feedback from patients and PWPs suggested that the intervention was feasible, acceptable and could potentially help patients to stay well after therapy. Patients confirmed the value of setting their own goals in the form of IMPS, receiving support from PWPs and in some cases from partners, friends and family members. Conclusions: Implementation intentions are a promising approach to support the self-management of depression.

AB Background People who inject drugs (PWID) have a high incidence of HIV, little access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and high mortality. We aimed to assess the feasibility of a future controlled trial based on the incidence of HIV, enrolment, retention, and uptake of the intervention, and the efficacy of an integrated and flexible intervention on ART use, viral suppression, and MAT use.
   Methods This randomised, controlled vanguard study was run in Kyiv, Ukraine (one community site), Thai Nguyen, Vietnam (two district health centre sites), and Jakarta, Indonesia (one hospital site). PWID who were HIV infected (index participants) and non-infected injection partners were recruited as PWID network units and were eligible for screening if they were aged 18-45 years (updated to 18-60 years 8 months into study), and active injection drug users. Further eligibility criteria for index participants included a viral load of 1000 copies per mL or higher, willingness and ability to recruit at least one injection partner who would be willing to participate. Index participants were randomly assigned via a computer generated sequence accessed through a secure web portal (3:1) to standard of care or intervention, stratified by site. Masking of assignment was not possible due to the nature of intervention. The intervention comprised systems navigation, psychosocial counselling, and ART at any CD4 count. Local ART and MAT services were used. Participants were followed up for 12-24 months. The primary objective was to assess the feasibility of a future randomised controlled trial. To achieve this aim we looked at the following endpoints: HIV incidence among injection partners in the standard of care group, and enrolment and retention of HIV-infected PWID and their injection partners and the uptake of the integrated intervention. The study was also designed to assess the feasibility, barriers, and uptake of the integrated intervention. Endpoints were assessed in a modified intention-to-treat popualtion after exclusion of ineligible participants. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02935296, and is active but not recruiting new participants.
   Findings Between Feb 5, 2015, and June 3, 2016, 3343 potential index participants were screened, of whom 502 (15%) were eligible and enrolled. 1171 injection partners were referred, and 806 (69%) were eligible and enrolled. Index participants were randomly assigned to intervention (126 [25%]) and standard of care (376 [75%]) groups. At week 52, most living index participants (389 [86%] of 451) and partners (567 [80%] of 710) were retained, and self-reported ART use was higher among index participants in the intervention group than those in the standard of care group (probability ratio [PR] 1.7, 95% CI 1. 4-1. 9). Viral suppression was also higher in the intervention group than in the standard of care group (PR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2). Index participants in the intervention group reported more MAT use at 52 weeks than those in the standard of care group (PR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2). Seven incident HIV infections occurred, and all in injection partners in the standard of care group (intervention incidence 0.0 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0. 0-1. 7; standard of care incidence 1.0 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 0.4-2.1; incidence rate difference -1.0 per 100 person-years, 95% CI -2.1 to 1.1). No severe adverse events due to the intervention were recorded.
   Interpretation This vanguard study provides evidence that a flexible, scalable intervention increases ART and MAT use and reduces mortality among PWID. The low incidence of HIV in both groups impedes a future randomised, controlled trial, but given the strength of the effect of the intervention, its implementation among HIV-infected PWID should be considered.

AB Best possible Self (BPS) is a positive psychological intervention based on positive future thinking. It has been shown to be effective in improving well-being and depressive symptoms over short periods of time. Positive technology is a scientific approach designed to increase well-being through Information and Communication Technologies. To assess the efficacy of the BPS implemented through a positive technology application in improving optimistic thinking, affect and depressive symptoms, during a one-month period, with two follow-ups one and three months later. Randomized, single-blind control trial. Central randomization was performed by an independent researcher using computer software to generate lists allocating participants to treatments. Recruitment was carried out through advertisements at two universities. Randomized participants were 78 young adults who were assigned to the e-BPS condition (n = 38) or to a control group (n = 40). Participants were asked to visualize their BPS each day using a Positive Technology Application. The Control condition consisted of thinking and writing about daily activities, also through technologies. Affect, future expectations, and depressive symptoms were measured in different time frames. 78 participants were analyzed using intention-to-treat analyses. Results showed that BPS was effective in improving future expectations measures and reducing depressive symptoms until the post-training. However, these effects were not maintained in the three-month follow-up period. This study indicates that BPS can be effectively adapted for implementation through positive technologies. Factors such as the variety of exercises and the instructions can play a role in maintaining the changes in the long term.

AB Using a dual-process framework, the aim of this research was to investigate the associations between reflective and impulsive processes and saving behavior. Self-control and saving habit were tested as additional factors that potentially moderate the relationship between constructs representing reflective and impulsive processes and behavior, or exert indirect effects on behavior through these systems. A community sample of 594 participants completed measures of saving intention, buying impulsiveness. trait self-control, saving automaticity, and propensity to save money. A well-fitting variance-based structural equation model, goodness-of-fit index = 0.338, average path coefficient = .119, p < .001, accounted for statistically significant amounts of variance in the key dependent variables: intention to save, R-2 = .364, buying impulsiveness. R-2 = .232, and saving behavior, R-2 = .173. Self-control and saving habit were indirectly related to saving behavior through intention, and buying impulsiveness was directly related to behavior when saving habits were low. Findings indicate strong saving habits may help to protect against impulsive spending and offer several targets for interventions aimed at improving saving behavior.

AB Objective: High prevalence of sedentary behaviour is seen in most immigrant groups in Western countries, particularly in those from the Indian subcontinent. The primary objective of this study was to determine the sociocognitive associations with intention to undertake physical activity (PA) among separate groups of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi older adults aged >= 60 years in the North West of England, UK.
   Study design: Cross-sectional survey
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey, informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), 138 of 964 South Asian (SA) older adults completed a mailed questionnaire that assessed self-reported PA and TPB variables.
   Results: Associations were seen in beliefs about PA and the amount of PA undertaken (rho = 0.18, P = 0.04). Attitude was correlated with intention (rho = 0.29, P = 0.01) and amount of PA undertaken (rho = 0.21, P = 0.02). Subjective norm was correlated with intention to undertake PA (rho = 0.21, P = 0.02). Between-group differences were seen between (1) Indian and Pakistani group's in subjective norm; (2) all ethnicities in intention to undertake PA; and (3) in the amount and attitude to undertaking PA between men and women. Comorbidity was associated with beliefs about PA uptake.
   Conclusions: Subgroup differences between Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi older adults in subjective norm and intention to undertaking PA highlight the importance of tailoring interventions to accommodate for subgroup differences when developing culturally appropriate PA interventions aimed at increasing uptake and adherence.

AB Although numerous factors have been demonstrated in laboratory settings to lead to more successful health goal attainment, their actual use in daily goal pursuit is unknown. This study examines spontaneously reported health goals and their characteristics in a sample of 557 American adults. Participants responded to questions about health and health goals, with items assessing motivation, social support, and implementation intentions. In all, 66 percent of respondents had a health goal, 26 percent of participants had implementation intentions, and 47 percent received support from close others. Results suggest that interventions should focus on encouraging goal setting, teaching implementation intentions, and educating close others in providing support.

AB The use of multiple imputation has increased markedly in recent years, and journal reviewers may expect to see multiple imputation used to handle missing data. However in randomized trials, where treatment group is always observed and independent of baseline covariates, other approaches may be preferable. Using data simulation we evaluated multiple imputation, performed both overall and separately by randomized group, across a range of commonly encountered scenarios. We considered both missing outcome and missing baseline data, with missing outcome data induced under missing at random mechanisms. Provided the analysis model was correctly specified, multiple imputation produced unbiased treatment effect estimates, but alternative unbiased approaches were often more efficient. When the analysis model overlooked an interaction effect involving randomized group, multiple imputation produced biased estimates of the average treatment effect when applied to missing outcome data, unless imputation was performed separately by randomized group. Based on these results, we conclude that multiple imputation should not be seen as the only acceptable way to handle missing data in randomized trials. In settings where multiple imputation is adopted, we recommend that imputation is carried out separately by randomized group.

AB Objective To explore demographic, socio-economic, and reproductive factors associated with pregnancy desire among adolescents in five Latin American countries.
   Design Secondary analysis using nationally representative, crosssectional data from UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
   Setting Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, and Panama.
   Population Adolescents 15-19 years old who were pregnant or mothers (n = 4207).
   Methods Chi-square tests, simple linear regressions, and multilevel Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations between individual- and country-level factors associated with pregnancy desire among adolescents.
   Main outcome measures Desire for pregnancy among adolescents who were pregnant or had given birth in the last 2 years.
   Results The proportion of adolescents who reported they desired their last pregnancy ranged from 79.3% in Cuba to 37.6% in Panama; approximately half the adolescents in Mexico, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic desired their last pregnancy. The multilevel analysis shows that pregnancy desire was more likely among adolescent women who were less educated [prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-0.98], older (PR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.04-1.09), married or cohabiting with a partner (PR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93), and had low parity (PR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.76).
   Conclusions Adolescents with less education, who are older, married or cohabiting, and with low parity were more likely to desire their pregnancy. These data constitute evidence that, in conjunction with qualitative and implementation research, can be used to better design services for adolescents so they can exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, and plan healthier and more satisfying futures.

AB We conducted a systematic review of safer conception strategies (SCS) for HIV-affected couples in sub-Saharan Africa to inform evidence-based safer conception interventions. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched fifteen electronic databases using the following inclusion criteria: SCS research in HIV-affected couples; published after 2007; in sub-Saharan Africa; primary research; peer-reviewed; and addressed a primary topic of interest (SCS availability, feasibility, and acceptability, and/or education and promotion). Researchers independently reviewed each study for eligibility using a standardized tool. We categorize studies by their topic area. We identified 41 studies (26 qualitative and 15 quantitative) that met inclusion criteria. Reviewed SCSs included: antiretroviral therapy (ART), pre-exposure prophylaxis, timed unprotected intercourse, manual/self-insemination, sperm washing, and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC). SCS were largely unavailable outside of research settings, except for general availability (i.e., not specifically for safer conception) of ART and VMMC. SCS acceptability was impacted by low client and provider knowledge about safer conception services, stigma around HIV-affected couples wanting children, and difficulty with HIV disclosure in HIV-affected couples. Couples expressed desire to learn more about SCS; however, provider training, patient education, SCS promotions, and integration of reproductive health and HIV services remain limited. Studies of provider training and couple-based education showed improvements in communication around fertility intentions and SCS knowledge. SCS are not yet widely available to HIV-affected African couples. Successful implementation of SCS requires that providers receive training on effective SCS and provide couple-based safer conception counseling to improve disclosure and communication around fertility intentions and reproductive health.

AB Teacher professional development and in-class mentors were used to support structured inquiry with math manipulatives. Twenty-four primary schools (n = 6,628 students) were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups as an experimental field trial to examine the effectiveness of this instructional approach in a scaled-up application in Belize for the duration of a school year. Implementation fidelity measures were collected permitting evaluation of two separate multilevel models: intention-to-treat and test-of-treatment. Both quantitative and qualitative evidence suggest students within this culture respond well to this relatively simple and inexpensive intervention that departs from traditional, expository math instruction in many developing countries. Policy implications are discussed that supported nationwide rollout of the intervention.

AB ObjectivesTo develop and test a volitional help sheet-based tool to improve physical activity in breast cancer survivors compared to a standard self-generated implementation intention intervention.
   DesignPilot randomized trial conducted online over 3months.
   MethodsParticipants were randomized to an online volitional help sheet (n=50) or implementation intention (n=51) intervention. Measures were taken at baseline, 1 and 3months. The main outcome measure was moderate-strenuous leisure timephysical activity. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life and mood.
   ResultsParticipants exposed to the volitional help sheet and implementation intention interventions showed similar effects after 1month, with both groups reporting a significant increase in moderate-strenuous physical activity. After 3months, the initial increase in physical activity was maintained by the volitional help sheet group, but not the implementation intention group. Improvements were also found for negative affect and emotional quality of life.
   ConclusionWhile both interventions show promise in promoting physical activity in breast cancer survivors, the volitional help sheet may be more effective for facilitating lasting change and emotional well-being. Findings suggest that the volitional help sheet may have potential to offer a cost-effective contribution to consumer-led tertiary preventive health. Future research should test these initial findings in a definitive trial.

ID RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; USER ACCEPTANCE; INTERNET; TECHNOLOGY
AB Objective: Online cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) is effective in supporting patients' self-management. Since iCBT differs from face-to-face CBT on several levels, proper training of therapists is essential. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a therapist training based on theoretical domains that are known to influence implementation behavior, for an iCBT for chronic pain.
   Methods: The training consists of 1.5 days and covers the implementation domains "knowledge", "skills", "motivation", and "organization", by focusing on the therapy's rationale, iCBT skills, and implementation strategies. Using an evaluation questionnaire, implementation determinants (therapist characteristics, e-health attitude, and implementation domains) and iCBT acceptance were assessed among participants after training.
   Results: Twenty-two therapists participated, who generally showed positive e-health attitudes, positive implementation expectations, and high iCBT acceptance. Organizational aspects (e.g., policy regarding iCBT implementation) were rated neutrally.
   Conclusions: An iCBT therapist training was developed and initial evaluations among participants showed favorable implementation intentions. Practice implications: Therapists' positive training evaluations are promising regarding the dissemination of iCBT in daily practice. Organizational support is vital and needs to be attended to when selecting organizations for iCBT implementation. (C) Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HRM IMPLEMENTATION; EMPLOYEE OUTCOMES; LINE MANAGEMENT; SELF;
   PERFORMANCE; WORK; ORGANIZATIONS; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; CONCEPTUALIZATION
AB Prior work has questioned whether human resource management (HRM) lives up to the organizational benefits it espouses. The intentions underlying human resource (HR) practices often differ from how they are implemented by line managers or how they are ultimately perceived by followers, thus undermining the strength of the HR system in influencing organizational outcomes and with them the overall reputation of HRM. We argue that line managers, specifically those who display authentic leadership behaviors, can strengthen an HR system (i.e., aligning intended, actual, and perceived HR policies and practices) by implementing HR practices in a way that they are perceived as distinct, consistent, and reflecting consensus. Authentic leadership theory departs from more traditional, top-down fit perspectives in strategic HRM to consider the dynamic way in which individuals within an organizational context co-create felt and perceived authenticity in interaction with others. In other words, by providing a more dynamic approach to creating alignment in HRM, authentic leadership helps HRM attain more authenticity and credibility in the organization.

AB This article presents a new agenda for the meaningful engagement of youth in guiding research and policy. It has been codeveloped with youth, adolescents, and children who are living with and affected by HIV. We set out 6 basic requirements (we call them RIGHTS) that hold across clinical trials, observational studies, implementation science, service delivery, and policy development. These requirements are based on a literature review and in-depth consultations with children, adolescents, and youth, which have taken place over a decade in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Youth engagement must be adequately Resourced with time, training, technical support, and funds. It must be Impactful, with youth informed of how their inputs have been directly used in research, policy, and programming. It must be Genuine, with youth understanding the intentions of the project and choosing to take part. It is essential that we ensure that participation is Harmless, and that it is responsive to the emotional and mental health needs of youth. Processes of participation should be Teen friendly, designed to be enjoyable and relevant to youth priorities. Finally, regarding Skills building, participation should allow for the competencies and skills developed to be recognized in youth education and career experience (without advertising the HIV aspect if this is inappropriate for young people). We propose that these 6 basic requirements be endorsed by all research organizations, and that they become a core component of research in the HIV response.

AB Context facilitates the recognition of forthcoming actions by pointing to which intention is likely to drive them. This intention is thought to be estimated in a ventral pathway linking MTG with frontal regions and to further impact on the implementation of sensory predictions within the action observation network (AON). Additionally, when conflicting intentions are estimated from context, the DLPFC may bias action selection. However, direct evidence for the contribution of these areas to context-embedded action representations in the AON is still lacking. Here, we used a perturb-and-measure TMS-approach to disrupt neural activity, separately in MTG and DLPFC and subsequently measure cortico-spinal excitability while observing actions embedded in congruent, incongruent or ambiguous contexts. Context congruency was manipulated in terms of compatibility between observed kinematics and the action goal suggested by the ensemble of objects depicted in the environment. In the control session (vertex), we found an early facilitation and later inhibition for kinematics embedded in congruent and incongruent contexts, respectively. MTG stimulation altered the differential modulation of M1 response to congruent vs. incongruent contexts, suggesting this area specifies prior representations about appropriate object graspability. Interestingly, all effects were abolished after DLPFC stimulation highlighting its critical role in broader contextual modulation of the AON activity.

AB Background High levels of alcohol consumption are an enduring health risk among college students. Integrating multiple, complementary behavior change theories may offer a promising approach to promote reductions in alcohol consumption.
   Purpose The current study tested if integrating self-affirmation and implementation intentions would be more effective than a self-affirmation only, implementation intentions only, or control condition at reducing alcohol consumption in college students over a 2-week period.
   Method Two hundred and ninety-three college students who reported drinking in the past month were randomly assigned to a condition in a 2 (self-affirmation: values vs. control writing task) x 2 (implementation intentions: formed vs. not formed) between-subjects factorial design. Participants first completed a self-affirmation or control writing task, then read an article describing the risks of drinking. Next, all participants reported their common drinking behaviors and contexts, and then selected two harm-reduction strategies forming (or not forming) implementation intentions to use the strategies. Alcohol consumption was measured 1 and 2 weeks after the experiment.
   Results Participants in the integrated self-affirmation and implementation intention condition were most likely to abstain from drinking 1 week later. Affirmed participants continued to be more likely to abstain from drinking 2 weeks later.
   Conclusions The findings support the efficacy of integrating self-affirmation and implementation intentions to reduce college student drinking (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02926794).

ID PRACTITIONERS; INTENTIONS; GPS
AB Objectives This study aims to analyse the associations between general practitioner (GP) retirement, job satisfaction and attitudes towards a mandatory accreditation scheme. External interventions such as mandatory accreditation schemes may be perceived negatively by GPs, causing early retirement from practice. In Denmark, almost half of the GPs had negative attitudes prior to the implementation of a mandatory accreditation scheme, constituting a possible risk of early practice retirement.
   Setting In January 2015 all 3,404 Danish GPs were invited to participate in a survey on attitudes towards a forthcoming mandatory accreditation programme.
   Participants 1,906 GPs (56%) answered the questionnaire. In total, 391 (11%) retired from practice in the following period from 1 January 2015 to 31 January 2017. Of these, 193 GPs (49%) answered the questionnaire.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was GP retirement. Labour union data on practice retirement were linked with data from the questionnaire survey on job satisfaction and attitudes prior to implementation of mandatory accreditation. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the associations between practice retirement and job satisfaction and attitudes towards accreditation.
   Results Practice retirement was associated with job dissatisfaction (OR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.7). Retirement was not associated with any of the other surveyed attitudinal variables. Retirement rate was relatively high in the accreditation start-up period.
   Conclusion Practice retirement was associated with job dissatisfaction but not to a priori attitudes towards an upcoming mandatory accreditation programme. However, the retirement rate was relatively high in the start-up period of the accreditation programme. Future research should evaluate the effects of external interventions on preterm retirement from general practice.

AB Context: Currently, significant attention is focused on improving care for patients with concussions through legislative mandates that include educational interventions. Few researchers have examined young athletes' concussion knowledge and the factors that may influence their knowledge.
   Objective: To use the socioecological model to examine demographic, parental, and personal factors associated with youth athletes' knowledge of concussion. Our ultimate goal is to inform the planning and implementation of youth sport concussion-related interventions.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Gymnasium and classroom.
   Patients or Other Participants: North Carolina and Arizona youth athletes (n = 225; age = 8 to 15 years) active in football, boys' or girls' soccer, boys' or girls' ice hockey, or boys' or girls' lacrosse in 2012-2013.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed a validated, self-administered survey. The intention and belief measures were guided by the theory of planned behavior. Perceptions of concussion and intention to seek care were examined using descriptive statistics. Athletes' concussion knowledge was modeled using linear regressions and generalized estimating equations, with child demographic and personal factors and parental knowledge and attitudes about concussion as predictors.
   Results: Geography, sport, parental attitudes toward concussion, and athlete age were associated with athlete knowledge in the univariable analyses (P < .10). In the multivariable model, geographic location (North Carolina versus Arizona, mean difference [MD] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 3.2), sport (girls' soccer versus girls' lacrosse, MD = 2.2, 95% CI = 0.7, 3.6), more favorable parental attitudes toward concussion (MD = 1.2 for a 2-standard deviation shift; 95% CI = 0.3, 2.1), and older age (>12 years, MD = 1.6; 95% CI = 0.5, 2.6) were associated with better knowledge about concussion.
   Conclusions: Geographic location, sport, parental attitudes about concussion, and athlete's age influenced athletes' concussion-related perceptions, indicating the need to address multiple levels of the socioecological model when targeting youth sport interventions. Parental interventions that translate to an improved culture of youth sport by improving youth athletes' perceptions and experiences are key areas for future work.

AB It is widely known that vitamin D receptors have been found in neurons and glial cells, and their highest expression is in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus and subcortical grey nuclei, and substantia nigra. Vitamin D helps the regulation of neurotrophin, neural differentiation, and maturation, through the control operation of growing factors synthesis (i.e., neural growth factor [NGF] and glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF), the trafficking of the septohippocampal pathway, and the control of the synthesis process of different neuromodulators (such as acetylcholine [Ach], dopamine [DA], and gamma-aminobutyric [GABA]). Based on these assumptions, we have written this review to summarize the potential role of vitamin D in neurological pathologies. This work could be titanic and the results might have been very fuzzy and even incoherent had we not conjectured to taper our first intentions and devoted our interests towards three mainstreams, demyelinating pathologies, vascular syndromes, and neurodegeneration. As a result of the lack of useful therapeutic options, apart from the disease-modifying strategies, the role of different risk factors should be investigated in neurology, as their correction may lead to the improvement of the cerebral conditions. We have explored the relationships between the gene-environmental influence and long-term vitamin D deficiency, as a risk factor for the development of different types of neurological disorders, along with the role and the rationale of therapeutic trials with vitamin D implementation.

ID COMMUNITY FORESTRY; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; POLICY
AB Indonesia is undergoing major policy changes, seeking to expand social forestry designations from less than 1% (1.1 million hectares) to over 10% (12.7 million hectares) of the Forest Estate. Expanding designations is at once a landmark reform and a call for caution, raising questions about policy intentions, and practical concerns about legal, technical, and implementation mechanisms. Social forestry literature highlights three key tenets, namely efforts that: confer rights to local communities, support livelihoods, and achieve conservation outcomes. This paper examines social forestry implementation from a cross-section of sites in South Sulawesi by reflecting on sustained action research between 2012-2016. The approach critically juxtaposes social forestry policy intent with implementation at three different sites. Findings indicate social forestry implementation suffers from historically problematic state enclosures and flawed land administration processes, entrenched political-economic interests among local actors, and lack of institutional engagement beyond the permitting process. Shortcuts to addressing entrenched conflict will only heighten tensions or further marginalize the most vulnerable, without guarantees to conservation outcomes.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
AB Development of software agents according to belief-desire-intention (BDI) model usually becomes challenging due to autonomy, distributedness, and openness of multi-agent systems (MAS). Hence, here, a domain-specific modelling language (DSML), called DSML4BDI, is introduced to support development of BDI agents. The syntax of the language provides the design of agent components required for the construction of the system according to the specifications of BDI architecture. The implementation of designed MAS on Jason BDI platform is also possible via model-to-text transformations built in the DSML. The comparative evaluation results showed that a significant amount of artefacts required for the exact MAS implementation can be automatically achieved by employing DSML4BDI. Moreover, time needed for developing a BDI agent system from scratch can be reduced to one-third in the case of using DSML4BDI. Finally, qualitative assessment, based on the developers' feedback, exposed how DSML4BDI facilitates development of BDI agents.

AB Objective: The NIH-developed Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is successful in achieving clinically significant weight loss in individuals with overweight/obesity when delivered one-on-one. The group-based DPP is less effective, with average weight losses of only 3.5%. The objective of this study was to increase weight loss outcomes of the group-based DPP by integrating habit formation tools (i.e., if-then plans). This two-arm randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of the habit formation-enhanced group-based DPP compared with the standard group-based DPP on changes in body weight (primary outcome). This study presents the 3- and 12-month results of this 24-month trial.
   Methods: A total of 208 participants were randomly assigned to the standard or enhanced DPP, and 172 participated. Participants were men and women with overweight/obesity who self-reported less than 200 min/wk of exercise.
   Results: Both groups achieved high weight losses at 3 (5.76%) and 12 (9.98%) months, with no differences between groups (chi(2) < 1). Both groups improved in blood pressure and physical activity.
   Conclusions: If-then plans did not result in higher weight loss. Both program versions resulted in higher weight loss than the group-based DPP. This may suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy skills of the coaches (clinical psychology doctoral students) was a key factor in treatment outcome.

AB Rationale: The United States courts have blocked the implementation of graphic warning labels on cigarette packages (GWLs). This decision was based, in part, on the premise that GWLs are unnecessarily emotional and are meant to scare rather than inform consumers about smoking's health effects. However, research in judgment and decision-making suggests these relationships are more complex.
   Objective: In this article, we draw on several theoretical frameworks that lead to competing hypotheses about the relationships between negative affect, health risk beliefs, and quit intentions (among adult smokers) or susceptibility to start smoking (among non-smoking youth).
   Method: We tested these competing mediation models using data from two experiments with two populations each adult smokers (Ns = 313 and 238) and primarily non-smoking middle-school youth (Ns = 340 and 237). Using mobile recruitment methods, we focused specifically on individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in rural and urban areas of the Northeastern United States.
   Results: The best fitting model across all four datasets was one in which label-induced negative affect (a) directly predicted intentions/susceptibility but also (b) indirectly predicted intentions/susceptibility via risk beliefs. Although mediation analyses did not demonstrate significant serial mediation effects of label exposure on intentions/susceptibility through negative affect then risk beliefs, there was some evidence that label exposure indirectly promoted adults' quit intentions through negative affect. Additionally, negative affect consistently mediated the indirect effect of label exposure on strengthened risk beliefs among adults and youth.
   Conclusions: These results speak to the importance of negative affect in directly motivating adult smokers' quit intentions but also serving an informational function, directing adult smokers and non-smoking youth to accept the health risks of smoking.

AB Background: Adherence to guidelines for patients with proximal femur fracture is suboptimal.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of a care pathway for the in-hospital management of older geriatric hip fracture patients on adherence to guidelines and patient outcomes.
   Design: The European Quality of Care Pathways study is a cluster randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: 26 hospitals in Belgium, Italy and Portugal.
   Subjects: Older adults with a proximal femur fracture (n = 514 patients) were included.
   Methods: Hospitals treating older adults (>65) with a proximal femur fracture were randomly assigned to an intervention group, i.e. implementation of a care pathway, or control group, i.e. usual care. Thirteen patient outcomes and 24 process indicators regarding in-hospital management, as well as three notrecommended care activities were measured. Adjusted and unadjusted regression analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat procedures.
   Results: In the intervention group 301 patients in 15 hospitals were included, and in the control group 213 patients in 11 hospitals. Sixty-five percent of the patients were older than 80 years. The implementation of this care pathway had no significant impact on the thirteen patient outcomes. The preoperative management improved significantly. Eighteen of 24 process indicators improved, but only two improved significantly. Only for a few teams a geriatrician was an integral member of the treatment team.
   Discussion: Implementation of a care pathway improved compliance to evidence, but no significant effect on patient outcomes was found. The impact of the collaboration between surgeons and geriatricians on adherence to guidelines and patient outcomes should be studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite positive attitudes towards augmented reality (AR) technology and the rich consumer experience that the technology offers, AR technology adoption and usage to enhance the customer experience in e -commerce is rather limited. In this research, leveraging on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, we propose various factors that influence the adoption intention of AR from an organizational perspective. Analysis of organizational adoption of AR for e-commerce will bring out important factors organizations should focus on while considering the implementation of AR technologies to enhance the shopping experience of their consumers. Specifically, the study theorizes the role of technological factors (technological competence and relative advantage), organizational factors (decision-makers' knowledge, financial strength, and top management support), and environmental factors (consumer readiness and competitive pressure) in influencing an organization's adoption of AR for e-commerce. We test the proposed research model via a sample of potential adopters from Singapore, India, and the USA. Results highlight the significant roles of technology competence, relative advantage, top management support, and consumer readiness in influencing an organization' s adoption intention of AR for e-commerce. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.

AB Four experiments examined the effect of proactive control on expressions of implicit racial bias. Whereas reactive control is engaged in response to a biasing influence (e.g., a stereotype, temptation, or distraction), proactive control is engaged in advance of such biases, functioning to strengthen task focus and, by consequence, limiting the affordance for a bias to be expressed in behavior. Using manipulations of response interference to modulate proactive control, proactive control was found to eliminate expressions of weapons bias, prejudice, and stereotyping on commonly used implicit assessments. Process dissociation analysis indicated that this pattern reflected changes in controlled processing but not automatic associations, as theorized, and assessments of neural activity, using event-related potentials, revealed that proactive control reduces early attention to task-irrelevant racial cues while increasing focus on task-relevant responses. Together, these results provide initial evidence for proactive control in social cognition and demonstrate its effectiveness at reducing expressions of implicit racial bias. Based on these findings and past research, we present a model of proactive and reactive control that offers a novel and generative perspective on self-regulation and prejudice reduction.

AB Purpose/Objective: After Rehabilitation, it is important to maintain adopted target behaviors such as physical activity and physical exercise. By generating detailed behavioral plans, rehabilitants may translate their intentions into actual behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Conscientiousness would further facilitate this mechanism in a way that rehabilitants who are more conscientious would be more likely to act upon their plans. Research Method/Design: The study presents secondary analyses from a larger intervention in cardiac and orthopedic rehabilitation. N = 136 rehabilitants were surveyed via online questionnaires during treatment (Time 1 [T1]) and with computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) 6 weeks (Time 2 [T2]) and 6 months (Time 3 [T3]) after discharge from the clinic. Intention, planning, Conscientiousness, and behavior were measured. A conditional process analysis examined whether Conscientiousness moderates the intention-planning-physical activity chain. Results: Planning had a mediating effect on intentions and physical activity. Moreover, this mediation effect was conditional on the level of Conscientiousness: Highly conscientious rehabilitants were more successful in translating their plans into behavior than their less conscientious counterparts. Conclusions/Implications: Self-regulatory mechanisms such as action-facilitating planning strategies may be more efficient in conscientious rehabilitants. Conscientiousness reflects dispositional self-regulation and can be supportive when it comes to maintain difficult behaviors. Lack of Conscientiousness needs to be compensated by more intense support of rehabilitation patients, in order to plan appropriately and to act upon these plans m the face ol barrieis.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether both self-control and alcohol abstinence self-efficacy mediate the relationship between purpose in life and alcohol self-regulation failure among male inpatients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). A total of 140 male patients with AUD were recruited from alcohol centers of four psychiatric hospitals in South Korea. All participants completed psychological assessments, including the Purpose in Life, the Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale, the Brief Self-Control Scale, and the Alcohol Self-Regulation Failure Scale. As hypothesized, the indirect effect analysis found that both self-control and abstinence self-efficacy may fully mediate the effects of purpose in life on alcohol self-regulation because the total effect was significant, but the direct effect was not significant. Moreover, bootstrap analysis found that the indirect effects were statistically significant. In conclusion, the effects of self-control and alcohol abstinence self-efficacy might not have different mediation effects on the relationship between purpose in life and alcohol self-regulation failure. These results suggest that both to enhance self-efficacy and self-control ability and to find purpose in life are important for AUD treatment.

AB IMPORTANCE Complex medication regimens pose self-management challenges, particularly among populations with low levels of health literacy.
   OBJECTIVE To test medication management tools delivered through a commercial electronic health record (EHR) with and without a nurse-led education intervention.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-group cluster randomized clinical trial was performed in community health centers in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included 794 patients with hypertension who self-reported using3 or more medications concurrently (for any purpose). Data were collected from April 30,2012, through February 29,2016, and analyzed by intention to treat.
   INTERVENTIONS Clinics were randomly assigned to to groups: electronic health record-based medication management tools (medication review sheets at visit check-in, lay medication information sheets printed after visits; EHR-alone group), EHR-based tools plus nurse-led medication management support (EHR plus education group), or usual care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes at 12 months included systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), medication reconciliation, knowledge of drug indications, understanding of medication instructions and dosing, and self-reported medication adherence. Medication outcomes were assessed for aii hypertension prescriptions, all prescriptions to treat chronic disease, and all medications.
   RESULTS Among the794 participants (68.6% women; mean [SD J age, 52.7 [9.6] years), systolic blood pressure at 12 months was greater in the EHR-alone group compared with the usual care group by 3.6 mm Hg (95% Q, 0.3 to 6.9 mm Hg), Systolic blood pressure i n the EHR pi us education group was not significantly lower compared with the usual care group (difference, -2.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.2 to 1.3 mm Hg) but was lower compared with the EHR-alone group (-5.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.8 to -2,4mm Hg). At 12 months, hypertension medication reconciliation was improved in the EHR-alone group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) and the EHR plus education group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to3.3) compared with usual care, Understanding of medication instructions and dosing was greater in the EHR plus education group than the usual care group for hypertension medications (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.8) and all medications combined (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). Compared with usual care, the EHR tools alone and EHR plus education interventions did not improve hypertension medication adherence (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.4 for both) or knowledge of chronic drug indications (OR for EHR tools alone, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6to1.5]and OR for EHR plus education, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7-1.7]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The study found that EHR tools in isolation improved medication reconciliation but worsened blood pressure.

AB Recent years have seen an increased interest in machine learning-based predictive methods for analyzing quantitative behavioral data in experimental psychology. While these methods can achieve relatively greater sensitivity compared to conventional univariate techniques, they still lack an established and accessible implementation. The aim of current work was to build an open-source R toolbox - "PredPsych" - that could make these methods readily available to all psychologists. PredPsych is a user-friendly, R toolbox based on machine-learning predictive algorithms. In this paper, we present the framework of PredPsych via the analysis of a recently published multiple-subject motion capture dataset. In addition, we discuss examples of possible research questions that can be addressed with the machine-learning algorithms implemented in PredPsych and cannot be easily addressed with univariate statistical analysis. We anticipate that PredPsych will be of use to researchers with limited programming experience not only in the field of psychology, but also in that of clinical neuroscience, enabling computational assessment of putative bio-behavioral markers for both prognosis and diagnosis.

AB There is a growing interest in understanding, as opposed to predicting, the repayment behavior of customers of financial institutions that provide loans. This study proposes a modified Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based clustering, which clusters repayment sequences across selected subsets of the HMM parameters. We demonstrate that different implementations of this modified adaptation helps us gain an in-depth understanding of various drivers that are hard to directly observe but nevertheless govern repayment. These include drivers such as the ability to repay (financial health of the customer) or the intention to repay independent of the ability (willful defaulting and unintentional delinquency). Algorithmically, we achieve this partially constrained HMM clustering (PC-HMM) by placing constraints on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm where a subset of parameters are used to cluster the repayments via the estimation process, while the other parameters are learned globally across all repayments. We compare our approach with three other baselines on a real-world loan repayment data set. We use an exogenous variable to validate and benchmark the clusters. We conclude our study with the observation that the ability to cluster on selective parameters, in conjunction with the structural construct of HMMs, enables the discovery of substantially more meaningful business insights than the baselines.

AB AimEarly intervention in psychosis (EIP) is a well-established approach with the intention of early detection and treatment of psychotic disorders. Its clinical and economic benefits are well documented. This paper presents basic aspects of EIP services, discusses challenges to their implementation and presents ideas and strategies to overcome some of these obstacles.
   MethodsThis paper is a narrative review about the evidence supporting EIP, with examples of successful implementation of EIP and of cases where major obstacles still need to be overcome.
   ResultsExperience from successfully implemented EIP services into the mental healthcare system have generated evidence, concepts and specific strategies that might serve as guidance or inspiration in other countries or systems where EIP is less well developed or not developed at all. Previous experience has made clear that evidence of clinical benefits alone is not enough to promote implementation, as economic arguments and political and social pressure have shown to be important elements in efforts to achieve implementation.
   ConclusionsUsers' narratives, close collaboration with community organizations and support from policy-makers and known people within the community championing early intervention (EI) services are just a few of the approaches that should be considered in campaigns for implementation of EI services. Fast progress in implementation is possible.

AB Background: The scope of pharmacist practice has expanded in many jurisdictions, including Nova Scotia, Canada, to include prescribing of medications.
   Objective: To identify the relationship between barriers and facilitators to pharmacist prescribing and self-reported prescribing activity using the Theoretical Domains Framework version 2 (TDF(v2)).
   Methods: The study was a self-administered electronic survey of all registered pharmacists (approximately 1300) in Nova Scotia, Canada. The questionnaire was developed using a consensus process that mapped facilitators and barriers to prescribing with the 14 domains of the TDF(v2). The questionnaire captured information about the type and rate of pharmacists' prescribing activities, pharmacists' perceptions of their prescribing role at the patient, pharmacist, pharmacy organization and health system level, and pharmacist demographics and practice settings. A 5-point Likert scale was used for most TDF(v2) domains. Cronbach's alpha was used to study the internal consistency of responses within each of the TDF(v2) domains and simple logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between TDF(v2) domain responses and self-reported prescribing activity. Open-ended questions were analyzed separately.
   Results: Eighty-seven pharmacists completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents were female (70 %), staff pharmacists (52 %) practicing pharmacy for a mean of 18 years. The three domains that respondents most positively associated with prescribing were Knowledge (84 %), Reinforcement (81 %) and Intentions (78 %). The largest effect on prescribing activity was the Skills domain (OR 4.41, 95% CI, 1.34-14.47).
   Conclusions: We determined the TDF(v2) domains associated with pharmacist self-reported prescribing behaviours. This understanding can assist the development of policy and program interventions at the pharmacist, pharmacy, and health system levels, to increase the uptake of pharmacist prescribing. Further work is needed to develop and implement interventions based on the domains identified, and to test these in pilot settings and then in large-scale interventions.

AB IoT based smart city idea is evolving with an intention of improving the quality of citizens' life by practicing information and communication technologies. Smart city concept is believed to be possible by integrating the evolving technologies such as internet of things (IoT), automation and machine learning in which IoT holds the key role. Authentication has already been identified as a foremost security concern around the IoT, as millions of small devices go online and begin to share their data. Authentication in IoT environment mainly considers the three types of communications: IoT device - IoT device, IoT device - IoT gateway, and IoT gateway - mobile client. In this paper, we design a protocol to address the authentication process between IoT gateway and mobile client. The proposed protocol's security is analyzed formally and informally to demonstrate robustness. Performance analysis of the proposed protocol has also paid adequate attention to show the probability of implementation in real time applications.

AB Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces decode users' intentions from the electroencephalogram; however, poor spatial resolution makes automatic recognition of these intentions a challenging task. New classification approaches with low computational costs and high classification performances need to be developed in order to increase the number of users benefitted by these systems. On the other hand, spiking neuron models, which are mathematical abstractions of real neurons, have shown good performances in several classification tasks, making these models suitable for motor imagery classification. In this work, two different encoding strategies for spiking neuron models, applied to the classification of motor imagery time-frequency features of stroke patients and healthy subjects, were evaluated. Classification performances and computational costs of spiking neuron models were compared against those of linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines and artificial neural networks. Results showed that a time-varying encoding strategy is more suitable for motor imagery classification, and its implementation computational cost is low. Therefore, a spiking neuron model with a time-varying encoding strategy could increase the number of potential users of brain-computer interfaces.

AB What are the roles of government institutions in the design and implementation of effective national security policy? Using the case of post-2010 reform to Britain's central government security policy machinery, we find that formal institutions can help the informal strategy-making institutions on their periphery to function better. Through interviews with 25 senior officials, we find that Britain's National Security Council and quinquennial Strategic Defence and Security Reviews - both instituted in 2010 with the intention of improving UK security policymaking - remain limited as formal makers of national strategy. But the networks of individuals and ideas they support, by absolving some decision-makers of audience costs while immersing others in creative yet coherent strategy-development communities, have improved the overall quality of UK security policymaking compared to its pre-2010 condition. This finding also carries implications for other contexts and thus represents a promising avenue for future research. (Final version accepted 20 June 2018.)

AB Governments and higher education institutions around the world are placing online learning in their respective visions and policies as it has already transformed the way in which individuals learn, socialise and do business. Leadership is therefore increasingly playing a major role in the implementation and success of online learning goals. Although researchers have investigated adoption and usage of online learning in different settings, the mediation role of transformational leadership is yet to be examined using the Delone and Mclean IS success model. Data collected from 448 students in nine Yemeni public universities and the subsequent analysis employing structural equation modelling (SEM) via SmartPLS 3.0, revealed five main results: first, overall quality (system, information, and service quality) has a positive impact on transformational leadership; second, transformational leadership has a positive impact on actual usage; third, overall quality has an indirect positive effect on actual usage via transformational leadership; fourth, actual usage significantly affects user satisfaction and performance impact; and fifth, user satisfaction has a positive impact on student performance. The proposed model explains 61% of the variance in performance impact, and theoretical and practical implications are provided as well.

AB This study sought feedback from teachers and adolescents on a novel intervention to reduce alcohol misuse based on the Prototype Willingness Model. A qualitative, think-aloud interview study was conducted with 17 adolescents aged 11-14years and nine teachers. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Adolescents found the content of the intervention appealing and credible. Teachers welcomed the content and format as a means of generating discussion. Moderate' drinking appeared to be an acceptable message, although difficult to define. Enacting if-then' plans in real social situations might be challenging and representations of drinking on social media should be considered.

AB Introduction: For many people with alcohol use disorders, alcohol drinking is a highly ingrained and automatized behavior with negative long-term health consequences. Implementation intentions, a behavioral intervention that links high-risk drinking situations with alternative, healthier responses, provide a means to intervene on habitual drinking behaviors. Here, a pilot treatment using implementation intentions was assessed with remote assessments and treatment prompts.
   Methods: Treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol use disorder between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited from the community from October 2014 to November 2016. Participants (N = 35) were quasi-randomly assigned to complete either active (n = 18) or control (n = 17) two-week implementation intention interventions. Active implementation intentions linked high-risk situations with alternative responses whereas the control condition selected situations and responses but did not link these together. Daily ecological momentary interventions of participant-tailored implementation intentions were delivered via text message. Alcohol consumption was assessed once daily with self-reported ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of drinks consumed the previous day and thrice daily remotely submitted breathalyzer samples to assess reliability of self-reports.
   Results: On drinking days (80% of days), the active implementation intentions group reduced alcohol consumption during the intervention period compared to the control condition; however the difference between consumption was not observed at one-month follow-up.
   Discussion: The implementation intention intervention was associated with a 1.09 drink per day decrease in alcohol consumption on drinking days compared to a decrease of 0.29 drinks per day in the control condition. Future studies may combine implementation intentions with other treatments to help individuals to reduce alcohol consumption.

AB Previous studies indicate that emotion-relevant impulsivity is related to depression and relatedly, suicidal ideation and behavior. Little is known, however, about underlying mechanisms driving this impulsivity. We hypothesized that participants diagnosed with depression would show difficulties with emotion-related impulsivity and inhibition compared to controls, and that there would be a link between inhibition deficits and emotion-relevant impulsivity. To test these hypotheses, 60 participants diagnosed with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD; 47 full-remission, 8 current MDD, 5 partial remission) and 100 nondepressed controls completed measures of impulsivity and current depressive symptoms, underwent a negative mood induction, and completed tasks that assessed components of inhibition: the ability to suppress pre-potent responses (antisaccade task) and the ability to resist interference (word-naming task). Although people with a history of MDD did not show cognitive inhibition deficits, they did endorse more emotion-related impulsivity, which in turn related to difficulty suppressing pre-potent responses. Limitations, as well as implications for future research and treatment are discussed.

AB Many large construction organisations use safety observation reporting (SOR) as part of their safety management system on sites, although research around their effectiveness in practice is limited. During an ethnographically informed research project, the lead author spent three years working with the health and safety team on a large (+500 pound m) construction project in the United Kingdom with such a system in place. The SOR system encouraged everyone on site to report unsafe acts or conditions, either via computer or handwritten cards, for subsequent action by the health and safety team. Despite good intentions, problems with the SOR system emerged. These included: significantly increased administration to deliver predictable data; poor data quality; an unwelcome focus on the number rather than content of the reports; their use as a tool to ascribe individual or organisational blame; and the perception that the SOR forms were being censored before they reached the health and safety team, which ultimately eroded trust between the workforce and management. Overall, the system as implemented on this site had the potential to cause more harm than good, and both disengage the workforce and frustrate the health and safety team. Although presented as a case study, it is suggested that the research methods used here have been able to expose and illuminate issues that would otherwise go unreported. It is recommended that these issues be considered within the design and implementation of such SOR systems in the future.

AB Background Current diagnostics for HIV-associated tuberculosis are suboptimal, with missed diagnoses contributing to high hospital mortality and approximately 374 000 annual HIV-positive deaths globally. Urine-based assays have a good diagnostic yield; therefore, we aimed to assess whether urine-based screening in HIV-positive inpatients for tuberculosis improved outcomes.
   Methods We did a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in two hospitals in Malawi and South Africa. We included HIV-positive medical inpatients aged 18 years or more who were not taking tuberculosis treatment. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), using a computer-generated list of random block size stratified by site, to either the standard-of-care or the intervention screening group, irrespective of symptoms or clinical presentation. Attending clinicians made decisions about care; and patients, clinicians, and the study team were masked to the group allocation. In both groups, sputum was tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). In the standard-of-care group, urine samples were not tested for tuberculosis. In the intervention group, urine was tested with the Alere Determine TB-LAM Ag (TB-LAM; Alere, Waltham, MA, USA), and Xpert assays. The primary outcome was all-cause 56-day mortality. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were prespecified based on baseline CD4 count, haemoglobin, clinical suspicion for tuberculosis; and by study site and calendar time. We used an intention-to-treat principle for our analyses. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN71603869.
   Findings Between Oct 26, 2015, and Sept 19, 2017, we screened 4788 HIV-positive adults, of which 2600 (54%) were randomly assigned to the study groups (n=1300 for each group). 13 patients were excluded after randomisation from analysis in each group, leaving 2574 in the final intention-to-treat analysis (n=1287 in each group). At admission, 1861 patients were taking antiretroviral therapy and median CD4 count was 227 cells per mu L (IQR 79-436). Mortality at 56 days was reported for 272 (21%) of 1287 patients in the standard-of-care group and 235 (18%) of 1287 in the intervention group (adjusted risk reduction [aRD] -2 center dot 8%, 95% CI -5 center dot 8 to 0 center dot 3; p=0 center dot 074). In three of the 12 prespecified, but underpowered subgroups, mortality was lower in the intervention group than in the standard-of-care group for CD4 counts less than 100 cells per mu L (aRD -7 center dot 1%, 95% CI -13 center dot 7 to -0 center dot 4; p=0.036), severe anaemia (-9 center dot 0%, -16 center dot 6 to -1 center dot 3; p=0 center dot 021), and patients with clinically suspected tuberculosis (-5 center dot 7%, -10 center dot 9 to -0 center dot 5; p=0 center dot 033); with no difference by site or calendar period. Adverse events were similar in both groups.
   Interpretation Urine-based tuberculosis screening did not reduce overall mortality in all HIV-positive inpatients, but might benefit some high-risk subgroups. Implementation could contribute towards global targets to reduce tuberculosis mortality.

AB Background: Most adolescents do not meet the recommendations for physical activity (PA) of at least 1 h per day. Individual planning (IP) interventions, including forming plans for when, where and how (action planning) to engage in a behavior, as well as the planning for how to deal with arising barriers (coping planning), are effective to enhance PA in adults. Collaborative planning (CP) is conjoint planning of two individuals regarding a behavior which is performed together. It is assumed that CP stimulates social exchange processes between the planning partners. However, it remains unclear whether planning interventions of PA in adolescents are successful and which planning intervention is more effective. Thus, this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines changes in daily moderate-to-vigorous PA in adolescents' friendship dyads resulting from planning. Individual self-regulating mechanism and social exchange processes are proposed as mediating mechanisms of the effects of planning for health behavior change.
   Methods: A single-blind four-arm parallel-group cluster-RCT is used. The sample consists of 400 friendship dyads between 14 and 18 years of age. As the recruitment takes place in schools, a cluster randomization of the schools is used to enroll dyads to (a) an IP intervention, (b) a CP intervention or (c) one of the two no-planning control conditions. Devise-measured and self-reported PA as the primary outcomes, self-regulatory strategies, and social exchange processes as secondary outcomes are assessed at three or four time points. After baseline measurement, the baseline ecological momentary assessment of the main variables takes place for 8 days followed by the intervention and a 7-days diary phase. Follow-ups are 1 month and 6 months later. Subsequent to the six-month follow-up, another 7-days diary phase takes place.
   Discussion: This is the first study examining IP in comparison to CP in adolescents applying a single-blind cluster RCT. Consequently, the study allows for understanding the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning and the underlying mechanisms in adolescent dyads.

The intention of this study is to explore the evidence base to support the potential future implementation of Tele-ICU program in China.Methods:We searched for published articles pertaining to Tele-ICU system with a centralized monitoring model between January 2000 and July 2017 using Cochrane Library, Academic Search Premier, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, British Education Index, MEDLINE, MLA International Bibliography, and Web of Science. Studies were coded by methodology, participants, and findings. The textual narrative synthesis method was applied to synthesize the outcomes.Results:Findings were categorized as follows: perceptions of the Tele-ICU (including the role of Tele-ICU, benefits for nurses, patients, and management); attitudes of Tele-ICU (usefulness and challenges of Tele-ICU); level of satisfaction; factors affecting acceptance of Tele-ICU.Discussion:This review has synthesized significant factors influencing optimal usage of Tele-ICU from nurses' perspectives. Also, it might make a better case for findings to support Tele-ICU future implementation into Chinese tertiary hospitals.

AB Background
   Implementation of risk-based prostate cancer screening has been proposed as a means to reduce the harms of PSA screening. Little is known, however, about the factors influencing men's decision to attend a prostate cancer screening based on a risk assessment.
   Method
   We sent postal invitations with a login to a survey to 10.000 men, three months before invitation to a risk-based prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer specific worry, prostate cancer-related knowledge, health behaviour, and health related quality of life were used as predictors of subsequent participation. Participation to risk-based prostate cancer screening was defined as providing a blood sample for the STHLM3 trial, a study evaluating a risk-based model that predicts the risk for aggressive prostate cancer.
   Results
   With a response rate of 20%, 1.347 men (70%) participated in ensuing risk-based prostate cancer screening three months later whereas 568 men (30%) declined participation in the STHLM3-study. These decliners reported less worry and feeling less vulnerable to prostate cancer and responded "Do not know" more often than participants when asked questions about prostate cancer knowledge. Participants reported greater benefits of prostate testing (p = 0.0005), less barriers to prostate testing (p<0.0001), and higher intention to attend prostate cancer testing (p<0.0001) than decliners. Finally, participants reported better overall health than decliners (p<0.0001).
   Conclusion
   Prostate cancer worry, PC knowledge, health behaviour and quality of life were identified as predictors of participation in risk-based prostate cancer screening. Targeting these predictors may improve the participation rates. These results can inform policymaking for future population-based prostate cancer screening programs that should address potential worry in men and lack of knowledge about prostate cancer.

AB Background Instructing and guiding patients after surgery is essential for successful recovery. However, the time that health-care professionals can spend with their patients postoperatively has been reduced because of efficiency-driven, shortened hospital stays. We evaluated the effect of a personalised e-health-care programme on return to normal activities after surgery.
   Methods A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial was done at seven teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18-75 years who were scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, inguinal hernia surgery, or laparoscopic adnexal surgery for a benign indication were recruited. An independent researcher randomly allocated participants to either the intervention or control group using computer-based randomisation lists, with stratification by sex, type of surgery, and hospital. Participants in the intervention group had access to a perioperative, personalised, e-health-care programme, which managed recovery expectations and provided postoperative guidance tailored to the patient. The control group received usual care and access to a placebo website containing standard general recovery advice. Participants were unaware of the study hypothesis and were asked to complete questionnaires at five timepoints during the 6-month period after surgery. The primary outcome was time between surgery and return to normal activities, measured using personalised patient-reported outcome measures. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done. This trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register, number NTR4699.
   Findings Between Aug 24, 2015, and Aug 12, 2016, 344 participants were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the intervention (n=173) or control (n=171) group. 14 participants (4%) were lost to follow-up, with 330 participants included in the primary outcome analysis. Median time until return to normal activities was 21 days (95% CI 17-25) in the intervention group and 26 days (20-32) in the control group (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1. 09-1. 73; p=0.007). Complications did not differ between groups.
   Interpretation A personalised e-health intervention after abdominal surgery speeds up the return to normal activities compared with usual care. Implementation of this e-health programme is recommended in patients undergoing intermediate-grade abdominal, gynaecological, or general surgical procedures.

AB The primary purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the efficacy of an unguided, 2-week internet-based training program to overcome procrastination, called ON. TOP. Because adherence is a typical problem among individuals who tend to procrastinate, especially with internet-based interventions, the secondary purpose of the present study was to investigate whether adding SMS support increases subjects' frequency of engagement in training. In a three-armed RCT (N = 161), the effects of the intervention alone and intervention with daily SMS-support were compared to a waiting list control condition in a sample of students. The primary outcome of interest was procrastination. The secondary outcome of interest was the extent of training behavior. Baseline (T0), immediate post-treatment (T1) and 8-week post-treatment (T2) assessments were conducted. Results indicated that procrastination decreased significantly only with intervention group with daily SMS support, relative to control. Moreover, incorporating SMS support also may enhance extent of training behavior.

DE health literacy; policy; policy analysis
ID OUTCOMES; GOAL
AB Health literacy has been a prominent issue on the agenda of the World Health Organization (WHO) for almost two decades. WHO recently established a strong global mandate for public policy action on health literacy by positioning it as one of three key pillars for achieving sustainable development and health equity in the Shanghai Declaration on Health Promotion. Several countries have national health literacy policies, with many others expected to develop them in the immediate future. It is, therefore, timely to examine current policy approaches to health literacy. The purpose of this study was to analyze a selection of existing policy documents for their strengths, limitations and themes, and offer observations about their potential to improve health literacy and health outcomes. In doing so our intention is to offer lessons and advice from early adopters that will have usefulness for future policy development and implementation. We selected six policies for review; Australia, Austria, China, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States. We used a set of criteria to guide a systematic analysis of policy documents for their context, intended target audiences, objectives, proposed actions and interventions, evidence of financial investment and intentions to monitor outcomes. We observed a number of common features that provide helpful signposting for future policy development in other countries. All represent a response to perceived deficiencies in the quality of patient communication and patient engagement. Most present health literacy as a universal challenge, with some also identifying groups who are of higher priority. They all recognize the importance of professional education in improving the quality of communication, and most recognize that the health literacy responsiveness of the health system needs to be improved. However, there was significant variability in linking resources to specific strategies and actions, as well as in the systems for monitoring progress and accountability for progress. This variability reflects important contextual differences between countries and health systems. However, this lack of specificity will likely have an impact on the priority given to improving health literacy and on the long-term sustainability of defined actions to improve health literacy in populations.

AB The utilisation of typological concepts of participation-based research on the community of practice (CoP) examines Uganda's public sector in relation to environmental impact assessment (EIA) of national projects. The re-assessment of participatory knowledge is analysed and incorporated into EIA project planning, design and implementation. A case study within the five divisions of the Kampala District used 250 semi-structured and open-ended survey questionnaires and 20 key informants by way of piecewise random sampling. The findings suggest that the majority of respondents were non-informed, on components of CoP, within the selected EIA projects. The CoP revealed concerns regarding Uganda's security and corruption which intertwined on how the CoP was conducted. We provide original data on the CoP in relation to EIA projects with the intention of facilitating public sector entities a suitable level of knowledge in aiding affected communities.

AB In many countries, sustainable public procurement is a powerful tool to reflect on national strategic intentions and promote scientific and technological innovation. Based on the perspective of an institutional structure, we filtered out the core policies. Using policy bibliometrics, we analyzed Chinese public procurement policies on promoting scientific and technological innovation, revealed policy-making characteristics, and concluded that the Ministry of Finance should appropriately decentralize the policy-making work to other relevant agencies of the State Council. This article compares the main policy tools from four dimensions in China, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, and South Korea. We issued these pertinent strategies: establishing the vendor database for small and medium enterprises, developing a grade system and the post-evaluation system, formulating detailed implementation methods for high-tech products (services), and carrying out classification management for imported products. For sustainable public procurement policies on promoting scientific and technological innovation, this article provides an effective reference to organize the agencies and formulate the detail measures. This article's research framework could be applied to analyze other industry policies.

AB Background
   Dizziness is common among older people and is associated with a cascade of debilitating symptoms, such as reduced quality of life, depression, and falls. The multifactorial aetiology of dizziness is a major barrier to establishing a clear diagnosis and offering effective therapeutic interventions. Only a few multidisciplinary interventions of dizziness have been conducted to date, all of a pilot nature and none tailoring the intervention to the specific causes of dizziness. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary dizziness assessment followed by a tailored multifaceted intervention would reduce dizziness handicap and self-reported dizziness as well as enhance balance and gait in people aged 50 years and over with dizziness symptoms.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted a 6-month, single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial in community-living people aged 50 years and over who reported dizziness in the past year. We excluded individuals currently receiving treatment for their dizziness, those with degenerative neurological conditions including cognitive impairment, those unable to walk 20 meters, and those identified at baseline assessment with conditions that required urgent treatment. Our team of geriatrician, vestibular neuroscientist, psychologist, exercise physiologist, study coordinator, and baseline assessor held case conferences fortnightly to discuss and recommend appropriate therapy (or therapies) for each participant, based on their multidisciplinary baseline assessments. A total of 305 men and women aged 50 to 92 years (mean [SD] age: 67.8 [8.3] years; 62% women) were randomly assigned to either usual care control; n = 151) or to a tailored, multifaceted intervention (n = 154) comprising one or more of the following: a physiotherapist-led vestibular rehabilitation programme (35% [n = 54]), an 8-week internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (19% [n = 29]), a 6-month Otago home-based exercise programme (24% [n = 37]), and/or medical management (40% [n = 62]). We were unable to identify a cause of dizziness in 71 participants (23% of total sample). Primary outcome measures comprised dizziness burden measured with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score, frequency of dizziness episodes recorded with monthly calendars over the 6-month follow-up, choice-stepping reaction time (CSRT), and gait variability. Data from 274 participants (90%; 137 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At trial completion, the DHI scores in the intervention group (pre and post mean [SD]: 25.9 [19.2] and 20.4 [17.7], respectively) were significantly reduced compared with the control group (pre and post mean [SD]: 23.0 [15.8] and 21.8 [16.4]), when controlling for baseline scores (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -3.7 [-6.2 to -1.2]; p = 0.003). There were no significant between-group differences in dizziness episodes (relative risk [RR] [95% CI]: 0.87 [0.65 to 1.17]; p = 0.360), CSRT performance (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -15 [-40 to 10]; p = 0.246), and step-time variability during gait (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -0.001 [-0.002 to 0.001]; p = 0.497). No serious intervention-related adverse events occurred. Study limitations included the low initial dizziness severity of the participants and the only fair uptake of the falls clinic (medical management) and the CBT interventions.
   Conclusions
   A multifactorial tailored approach for treating dizziness was effective in reducing dizziness handicap in community-living people aged 50 years and older. No difference was seen on the other primary outcomes. Our findings therefore support the implementation of individualized, multifaceted evidence-based therapies to reduce self-perceived disability associated with dizziness in middle-aged and older people.

AB Governing climate mitigation is complex, as the recurring gap between policy intentions and actions exhibits. Interventions at the urban scale represent an opportunity to implement energy policy targets. Urban development projects can function as carrier to implement innovative energy solutions as 'by-product'. To do so, planners must proactively and strategically deploy planning instruments to influence market behaviour, since project realization relies heavily on public-private interaction. This paper explores how local planning authorities use a variety of planning instruments in urban development projects that assist in implementing both planning and energy policy targets. To understand how planning instruments can be deployed deliberately to implement energy policy targets and why a specific instrument mix was chosen, this paper presents a cross-comparison of three urban development projects from Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, which all successfully implemented innovative energy solutions. Results show that contextual differences in the processes entail the use of specific instruments to implement energy policy targets. However, the deployed instrument types, enabling factors and involved governmental levels in the technology-open processes showed a similar pattern across all three cases.

AB Implementing strategic spatial plans is a complex task. The process involves strategy formation, institutional capacity building, funding mechanism establishment and governance arrangements, which take shape within complex power configurations. Based on empirical evidence gathered by interviewing regional planning experts, this paper focuses on the role of governance arrangements and funding mechanisms in current practices of strategic plan implementation in 14 European urban regions. This investigation was completed bearing in mind power configurations, which shape and frame governance arrangements and funding mechanism in planning practice. A cross-case comparison provides evidence that, among the governance arrangements influencing plan implementation, negotiation and interest groups involvement are pivotal. Negotiation involves private interest groups, such as real estate agencies and environmental non-governmental organizations. The paper shows that in some case studies private interest groups have a substantial bargaining power to negotiate, for example, the development of a new housing settlement or a retail facility, while other groups struggle to safeguard natural areas. It is also during negotiations that plan implementation intentions are prioritized, strategic urban projects are formulated and funding mechanisms are established. The paper demonstrates that to truly grasp plan implementation praxis it is necessary to go beyond multi-actor involvement and inter-scalar government cooperation. It is necessary to scrutinize the funding sources, investigate who wins and who loses while negotiations are happening, and how plan implementation decisions are actually made.

AB date land-change science has devoted little attention to spatial policy and planning in urban landscapes despite the widely accepted premise that planning affects urban land change. This is primarily due to lack of relevant data and an underdeveloped theoretical understanding regarding the impact of spatial planning on urban land change. To be able to better analyse the role of spatial planning in urban development we need to distinguish: 1) the intentions expressed in the plans; 2) the means of implementation of the plans through governance processes and 3) the role of external conditions influencing implementation. Based on a synthesis of the current literature on how spatial planning is implemented in land-change models, and drawing from the literature on planning evaluation, we sketch a research agenda to further develop the understanding of these three components and their interconnections as well as their application in quantitative land-change modelling approaches for urban regions.

AB Rule-based performance improves remarkably throughout childhood. The present study examined how children and adolescents structured tasks and implemented rules when novel task instructions were presented in a child-friendly version of a novel instruction-learning paradigm. Each miniblock started with the presentation of new stimulus-response mappings for a go task. Before this mapping could be implemented, subjects had to make responses in order to advance through screens during a preparatory (next) phase. Children (4-11 years old) and late adolescents (17-19 years old) responded more slowly during the next phase when the next response was incompatible with the instructed stimulus-response mapping. This instruction-based interference effect was more pronounced in young children than in older children. We argue that these findings are most consistent with age-related differences in rule structuring. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of rule-based performance, instruction-based learning, and development.

AB Background In cross-sectional surveys, increasing numbers of adolescents report using both electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and cigarettes. This study assessed whether adolescent e-cigarette use was associated prospectively with initiation or escalation of cigarette use.
   Methods Data were from 2836 adolescents (aged 13-14 years at baseline) in 20 schools in England. At baseline, breath carbon monoxide levels, self-reported e-cigarette and cigarette use, sex, age, friends and family smoking, beliefs about cigarette use and percentage receiving free school meals (measure of socioeconomic status) were assessed. At 12-month follow-up, self-reported cigarette use was assessed and validated by breath carbon monoxide levels.
   Results At baseline, 34.2% of adolescents reported ever using e-cigarettes (16.0% used only e-cigarettes). Baseline ever use of e-cigarettes was strongly associated with subsequent initiation (n=1726; OR 5.38, 95% CI 4.02 to 7.22; controlling for covariates, OR 4.06, 95% CI 2.94 to 5.60) and escalation (n=318; OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.21; controlling for covariates, this effect became non-significant, OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.82) of cigarette use.
   Conclusions This is the first study to report prospective relationships between ever use of e-cigarettes and initiation and escalation of cigarette use among UK adolescents. Ever use of e-cigarettes was robustly associated with initiation but more modestly related to escalation of cigarette use. Further research with longer follow-up in a broader age range of adolescents is required.

ID EQUIVALENCE
AB Dissolution profile comparisons are used in the context of postapproval changes where the manufacturer has to demonstrate that the quality of the product is not affected by the change. Around this topic, basic statistical principles are in conflict with widely used interpretations of current guidelines, resulting in time-intensive discussions in pharmaceutical practice. From a statistician's perspective, the following suggestions could improve the situation regarding statistical analysis, inference, and interpretation: (1) A clear definition of the variability criterion for the similarity factor, such as that found in the EMA guideline, would be helpful. (2) Sample size recommendations should be interpreted as minimum, not as maximum, requirements. (3) In case of several batches per reference or test group, pooled comparisons should be performed instead of multiple batch-to-batch comparisons. (4) FDA Guideline recommendations concerning multivariate equivalence procedures for highly variable dissolution profiles are based on the state of statistical knowledge in 1997 and need to be updated. (5) The T-2 test for equivalence is an appropriate method for comparing highly variable dissolution profiles. Application of the T-2 test for equivalence enables reliable equivalence decisions and satisfies the intention of reaching scientific evidence in decision making. Software implementations of this test are available in R and SAS. The article is a summary of the poster of the same name presented at the DIA FDA Statistics Forum 2016. The poster took the third place in the poster award of the conference.

AB People often form intentions but fail to follow through on them. Mounting evidence suggests that such intention-action gaps can be narrowed with prompts to make concrete plans about when, where, and how to act to achieve the intention. In this paper, we pushed the notion of plan-concreteness to test the efficacy of a prompt under a minimalist automated calling setting, where respondents were only prompted to indicate a narrower duration within which they intent to act. In a field experiment, this planning prompt significantly helped people to pay their past dues and get out of debt delinquency. These results suggest that minimalist automatic planning prompts are a scalable, cost-effective intervention.

   Inpatients: A Randomized Controlled Trial
SO INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASES-SOCIETY; GUIDELINES; AMERICA
AB DESIGN. We conducted a randomized, parallel, unblinded, superiority trial of a laboratory reporting intervention designed to reduce antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB).
   METHODS. Results of positive urine cultures from 110 consecutive inpatients at 2 urban acute-care hospitals were randomized to standard report (control) or modified report (intervention). The standard report included bacterial count, bacterial identification, and antibiotic susceptibility information including drug dosage and cost. The modified report stated: "This POSITIVE urine culture may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection. If urinary tract infection is suspected clinically, please call the microbiology laboratory ... for identification and susceptibility results." We used the following exclusion criteria: age <18 years, pregnancy, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, samples from patients already on antibiotics, neutropenia, or admission to an intensive care unit. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of appropriate antibiotic therapy prescribed.
   RESULTS. According to our intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the proportion of appropriate treatment (urinary tract infection treated plus ASB not treated) was higher in the modified arm than in the standard arm: 44 of 55 (80.0%) versus 29 of 55 (52.7%), respectively (absolute difference, -27.3%; RR, 0.42; P = .002; number needed to report for benefit, 3.7).
   CONCLUSIONS. Modified reporting resulted in a significant reduction in inappropriate antibiotic treatment without an increase in adverse events. Safety should be further assessed in a large effectiveness trial before implementation.

AB How does the current replication crisis, along with other recent psychological trends, affect scientific creativity? To answer this question, we consider current debates regarding replication through the lenses of creativity research and theory. Both scientific work and creativity require striking a balance between ideation and implementation and between freedom and constraints. However, current debates about replication and some of the emerging guidelines stemming from them threaten this balance and run the risk of stifling innovation. Although we recognize the importance of doing rigorous science, we argue that any one size fits all research guidelines being proposed or enforced will do more harm than good for scientific creativity.

AB Background Previous research suggests that the use of outcome feedback technology can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical improvement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an outcome feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services.
   Methods This multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial was done at eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, involving therapists who were qualified to deliver evidence-based low-intensity or high-intensity psychological interventions. Adult patients (18 years or older) who accessed individual therapy with participating therapists were eligible for inclusion, except patients who accessed group therapies and those who attended less than two individual therapy sessions. Therapists were randomly assigned (1:1) to an outcome feedback intervention group or a treatment-as-usual control group by use of a computer-generated randomisation algorithm. The allocation of patients to therapists was quasi-random, whereby patients on waiting lists were allocated sequentially on the basis of therapist availability. All patients received low-intensity (less than eight sessions) or high-intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychological therapies for the duration of the 1-year study period. An automated computer algorithm alerted therapists in the outcome feedback group to patients who were not on track, and primed them to review these patients in clinical supervision. The primary outcome was symptom severity on validated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) measures after treatment of varying durations, which were compared between groups with multilevel modelling, controlling for cluster (therapist) effects. We used an intention-to-treat approach. This trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number IS RCTN12459454.
   Findings In total, 79 therapists were recruited to the study between Jan 8, 2016, and July 15, 2016, but two did not participate. Of these participants, 39 (51%) were randomly assigned to the outcome feedback group and 38 (49%) to the control group. Overall, 2233 patients were included in the trial (1176 [53%] were treated by therapists in the outcome feedback group, and 1057 [47%] by therapists in the control group). Patients classified as not on track had less severe symptoms after treatment if they were allocated to the outcome feedback group than those in the control group (PHQ-9 d=0.23, B=-1.03 [95% CI -1.84 to -0.23], p=0.012; GAD-7 d=0.19, B=-0.85 [-1.56 to -0.14], p=0.019).
   Interpretation Supplementing psychological therapy with low-cost feedback technology can reduce symptom severity in patients at risk of poor response to treatment. This evidence supports the implementation of outcome feedback in stepped care psychological services.

AB Background Uptake of health checks for cardiovascular risk assessment in primary care in England is lower than anticipated. The question-behavior effect (QBE) may offer a simple, scalable intervention to increase health check uptake.
   Purpose The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced invitation methods employing the QBE, with or without a financial incentive to return the questionnaire, at increasing uptake of health checks.
   Methods We conducted a three-arm randomized trial including all patients at 18 general practices in two London boroughs, who were invited for health checks from July 2013 to December 2014. Participants were randomized to three trial arms: (i) Standard health check invitation letter only; (ii) QBE questionnaire followed by standard invitation letter; or (iii) QBE questionnaire with offer of a financial incentive to return the questionnaire, followed by standard invitation letter. In intention to treat analysis, the primary outcome of completion of health check within 6 months of invitation, was evaluated using a p value of.0167 for significance.
   Results 12,459 participants were randomized. Health check uptake was evaluated for 12,052 (97%) with outcome data collected. Health check uptake within 6 months of invitation was: standard invitation, 590 /4,095 (14.41%); QBE questionnaire, 630/3,988 (15.80%); QBE questionnaire and financial incentive, 629/3,969 (15.85%). Difference following QBE questionnaire, 1.43% (95% confidence interval -0.12 to 2.97%, p=.070); following QBE questionnaire and financial incentive, 1.52% (-0.03 to 3.07%, p=.054).
   Conclusions Uptake of health checks following a standard invitation was low and not significantly increased through enhanced invitation methods using the QBE.

AB This article aims to analyze the role that third-party product sustainability certifications play in supply chain sustainability governance and hence the impact that they may have on facilitating corporate life cycle management (LCM). Particular emphasis is given to exploring the extent to which such schemes allow firms to outsource the work of communication, motivation, enablement, and control of sustainability-related information and performance upstream in the supply chain.
   The research design is based on a comparative case study methodology. The corporate practices of sourcing the sustainability certified products in the food retailing and textile sectors are compared, to explain when third-party product sustainability certification reduces the corporate need to engage in collaborative relationships with suppliers, thereby reducing efforts associated with implementation of corporate life cycle management.
   In our study, we found evidence that affirms the role of third-party product sustainability certification in reducing corporate necessity to actively engage with coordination of sustainability issues upstream in the supply chain. However, we also identified a range of factors-the intention of the buying company, the supply chain context, and the design of the certification scheme-that influence the extent, to which third-party product sustainability certification replaces the corporate need for additional work to facilitate supplier compliance. Some of these factors, e.g., the design of the certification scheme, are new and have been underexplored in the supply chain management and value chain governance literature yet.
   Our findings suggest that corporate LCM practitioners should consider third-party sustainability certification as an instrument for the transfer of significant life cycle information along the supply chain and as a tool to facilitate corporate life cycle management. The extent to which third-party product sustainability certification would be able to facilitate corporate life cycle management depends not only on whether certification requirements are based on the LCA studies but also on the market scope of the certification schemes, the scope of the certification requirements, and the architecture of the certification management services. If these parameters are aligned with corporate ambitions and allow buyers to fully outsource the work associated with communication, motivation, enablement, and control of sustainability-related information and supplier performance, the life cycle management can be exercised by companies by simply choosing to procure sustainability certified products.

AB Objective: Imagery-based interventions represent an inexpensive, potentially effective technique for changing health behavior and promoting adaptive health outcomes. However, research adopting mental imagery techniques in health behavior interventions has shown considerable variability in effects across studies. In the present analysis we present a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of mental imagery interventions in health behavior and tested effects of key moderators. Method: A systematic database search for studies adopting imagery interventions in health behavior and related outcomes was conducted with additional manual searches and direct author contact for unpublished studies. Data were extracted for imagery intervention effects on behavioral, psychological, and physiological outcomes. and for candidate moderators. Results: Twenty-six studies of mental imagery intervention effects comprising 33 independent data sets met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. Mental imagery interventions led to nontrivial, small averaged corrected effect sizes on postintervention behavior, intention, perceived control, and attitude, and a small-to-medium sized effect on postintervention physiological measures. Suhstantive heterogeneity in the effects meant that a search for moderators was warranted. Moderator analyses indicated larger effects of imagery interventions on health behaviors in studies on older, nonstudent samples, when detailed instructions were provided, in studies with higher methodological quality scores, and in studies of longer duration. Effect sizes for imagery on behavioral and physiological outcomes were larger than effects on psychological outcomes. Conclusion: Results support effects of mental imagery interventions on health behaviors, identify conditions in which they may be more effective, and point to how future imagery interventions might be optimized.

AB It has been recognised that few cattle farmers undertake biosecurity practices on their farms. Approaches that take into consideration individuals' preparedness for change, alongside beliefs thought to motivate the enactment of certain behaviours, may provide a framework for actuating tangible change. The aim of this study was to use a combination of behaviour change models to link beliefs with behaviour and identify possible key interventions to improve the uptake of biosecurity measures by dairy cattle farmers in Great Britain (GB). This is the first study to explore farmers' practices and attitudes in relation to the prevention of direct (animal to animal contact); indirect (via fomites); and other biosecurity measures using a multitheory approach.
   A cross-sectional study was carried out, with postal questionnaires sent to 2505 dairy cattle farmers. Questions were asked about the extent to which a host of biosecurity measures were used, the influence of various stakeholders (e.g. veterinarians, industry bodies) in informing biosecurity choices, and the perceived control farmers felt they had over biosecurity on their farms. Farmer attitudes towards biosecurity were also explored. Two behaviour change models, the Transtheoretical Model, and the Theory of Planned Behaviour, were utilised. A variety of analysis methods were used to interrogate the data, including multivariable logistic regression.
   A total of 908/2505 (36.2%) farmers responded, with 757 responses (30.2%) deemed eligible for inclusion. Farmers generally fell into one of two categories: those that reported not applying biosecurity measures with no intention of doing so in the future, and those that reported undertaking biosecurity measures for some time. Farmers felt that biosecurity improved cattle health and welfare, but also felt that disease was inevitable. More farmers agreed with statements relating to their ability to control, rather than prevent disease. Analysis suggested a difference between influencing beliefs and whether specific types of measure were more likely to be undertaken. For example, farmers' beliefs about other stakeholders appeared to play a role in influencing the utilisation of measures preventing direct contact (e.g. nose to nose contact), rather than indirect contact (e.g. fomite transmission).
   The use of a combination of behaviour change models has identified key variables to use for interventional approaches targeted towards the different type of biosecurity measure (preventing direct or indirect transmission) to improve the uptake of biosecurity on dairy cattle farms in GB. Other industry stakeholders should be aware of these variables when working with farmers to achieve optimal cattle herd health.

AB Introduction: Though the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) calls for the implementation of large graphic warning labels (GWLs) on cigarette boxes, the courts have blocked the implementation of 50% labels in the United States. We conducted an experiment to explore whether changing the size of GWLs is associated with changes in visual attention, negative affect, risk beliefs, and behavioral intentions.
   Method: We recruited adult smokers (N = 238) and middle-school youth (N = 237) throughout the state of New York in May 2016. We randomly assigned participants to one of three between-subject conditions (no GWL [control], 30% GWL, 50% GWL).
   Results: Adult and youth participants looked at the GWLs longer when the GWL covered 50% versus 30% of the pack's front. Increasing GWL size from 30% to 50% did not influence negative affect or risk beliefs, though both GWL sizes increased negative affect relative to the no-GWL control group. Exposure to 50% GWLs increased adult smokers' intentions to quit compared to no-GWL, but smokers exposed to 30% GWLs did not differ from control. There were no differences between 50% GWLs, 30% GWLs, and control on youth smoking susceptibility.
   Conclusions: Findings provide some evidence of the benefits of a 50% versus 30% GWL covering the front of the pack for adult smokers and at-risk youth from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds-though not on all outcomes.
   Implications: This research shows that 30% GWLs on cigarette packages increase negative affect relative to packages without front-of-package GWLs. Larger GWLs on cigarette packages (50% vs. 30%) increase visual attention to the warning and its pictorial content among low-SES smokers and at-risk youth but do not further increase negative affect. A 50% GWL increased adults' quit intention compared to no GWL at all, but we were underpowered to detect modest differences in quit intentions between a 50% and 30% GWL. Future work should thus continue to explore the boundary conditions under which relatively larger GWLs influence cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes.

TI Contribution of Nepal's Free Delivery Care Policies in Improving

ID DEMAND-SIDE; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; MEDICAL-CARE; ACCESS; INDIA;

AB Background: Nepal has made remarkable improvements in maternal health outcomes. The implementation of demand and supply side strategies have often been attributed with the observed increase in utilization of maternal healthcare services. In 2005, Free Delivery Care (FDC) policy was implemented under the name of Maternity Incentive Scheme (MIS), with the intention of reducing transport costs associated with giving birth in a health facility. In 2009, MIS was expanded to include free delivery services. The new expanded programme was named "Aama" programme, and further provided a cash incentive for attending four or more antenatal visits. This article analysed the influence of FDC policies, individual and community level factors in the utilisation of four antenatal care (4 ANC) visits and institutional deliveries in Nepal.
   Methods: Demographic and health survey data from 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 were used and a multi-level analysis was employed to determine the effect of FDC policy intervention, individual and community level factors in utilisation of 4 ANC visits and institutional delivery services.
   Results: Multivariate analysis suggests that FDC policy had the largest effect in the utilisation of 4 ANC visits and institutional delivery compared to individual and community factors. After the implementation of MIS in 2005, women were three times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.020, P < .001) more likely to attend 4 ANC visits than when there was no FDC policy. After the implementation of Aama programme in 2009, the likelihood of attending 4 ANC visits increased six-folds (AOR = 6.006, P < .001) compared prior to the implementation of FDC policy. Similarly, institutional deliveries increased two times after the implementation of the MIS (AOR = 2.117, P < .001) than when there was no FDC policy. The institutional deliveries increased five-folds (AOR = 5.116, P < .001) after the implementation of Aama compared to no FDC policy.
   Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that MIS and Aama policies have had a strong positive influence on the utilisation of 4 ANC visits and institutional deliveries in Nepal. Nevertheless, results also show that FDC policies may not be sufficient in raising demand for maternal health services without adequately considering the individual and community level factors.

AB It is generally believed that Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) improve healthcare delivery by reducing medical errors and administrative costs. The potential benefits of HIEs together with the possible risks (such as health information privacy and security concerns) are crucial factors to healthcare consumers' opt-in intentions toward HIEs. To maximize the full value of HIEs, it is important to accurately investigate healthcare consumers' beliefs and perceptions about the widespread implementation of HIEs. To do so, we conducted an online survey in the United States using a sample with 683 data points. Drawing on the utility theory, we have found that the perceived benefits and perceived risks associated with HIEs significantly influence perceived value, which in turn increases consumers' opt-in decisions. The results indicate that perceived benefits seem to have a greater impact on perceived value than perceived risk. Moreover, perceived value fully mediates the relationships of perceived benefits and perceived risk with consumer opt-in intentions to HIEs. The findings also highlight that consumers' attitudes toward HIE models, the perceived trustworthiness of healthcare entities, the perceived health information sensitivity, and the perceived health status significantly influence the perceived risk of HIE efforts. This study contributes to both research and practice and provides directions for future studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diabetic retinopathy is a common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of new blindness among working-age adults in the United States. Timely intervention to prevent vision loss is possible with early detection by regular eye examinations. Unfortunately, adherence to recommended annual diabetic eye exams is poor. Public health interventions have targeted traditional barriers to care, such as cost and transportation, with limited success. Behavioral economics provides an additional framework of concepts and tools to understand low screening rates and to promote regular diabetic eye exams for populations at risk. In particular, behavioral economics outlines biases and heuristics that affect decision-making and underlie pervasive barriers to care, such as not viewing diabetic eye exams as a priority or perceiving oneself as too healthy to need an examination. In this review, we examine the literature on the use of behavioral economics interventions to promote regular diabetic eye exams. From the results of the included studies, we outline how concepts from behavioral economics can improve eye examination rates. In particular, the default bias, present bias, and self-serving bias play a significant role in precluding regular diabetic eye examinations. Potential tools to mitigate these biases include leveraging default options, using reminder messages, providing behavioral coaching, applying commitment contracts, offering financial incentives, and personalizing health messages. When combined with traditional public health campaigns, insights from behavioral economics can improve understanding of pervasive barriers to care and offer additional strategies to promote regular preventive eye care for patients with diabetes.

AB Background: Bowel cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Bowel screening has been shown to reduce mortality and primary care interventions have been successful in increasing uptake of screening. Using evidence-based theory to inform the development of such interventions has been shown to increase their effectiveness. This study aimed to develop and refine a brief evidence based intervention for eligible individuals whom have not responded to their last bowel screening invitation (non-responders),for opportunistic use by primary care providers during routine consultations.
   Methods: The development of a brief intervention involving a conversation between primary care providers and non-responders was informed by a multi-faceted model comprising: research team workshop and meetings to draw on expertise; evidence from the literature regarding barriers to bowel screening and effective strategies to promote informed participation; relevant psychological theory, and intervention development and behaviour change guidance. Qualitative telephone interviews with 1) bowel screening stakeholders and 2) patient non-responders explored views regarding the acceptability of the intervention to help refine its content and process.
   Results: The intervention provides a theory and evidence-based tool designed to be incorporated within current primary care practice. Bowel screening stakeholders were supportive of the intervention and recognised the importance of the role of primary care. Interviews highlighted the importance of brevity and simplicity to incorporate the intervention into routine clinical care. Non-responders similarly found the intervention acceptable, valuing a holistic approach to their care. Moreover, they expected their primary care provider to encourage participation.
   Conclusions: A theory-based brief conversation for use in a primary care consultation was acceptable to bowel screening stakeholders and potential recipients, reflecting a health promoting primary care ethos. Findings indicate that it is appropriate to test the intervention in primary care in a feasibility study.

ID MEASUREMENT MODEL; PROTOCOL; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Implementation is proposed to be a multiphase, multilevel process. After a period of exploration, an adoption decision is made, typically at the upper management or policy level. Nevertheless, movement through each of the subsequent phases of the implementation process involves clinicians or providers at the individual level to adopt the innovation and then change their behavior to use/deliver the innovation. Multiple behavioral change theories propose that intentions are a critical determinant of implementation behavior. However, there is a need for the development and testing of pragmatic measures of providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or evidence-based practice (EBP).
   Methods: Nine items were developed to assess providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or EBP. Motivational interviewing was the EBP in the study. Items were administered, as part of larger survey, to 179 providers across 38 substance use disorder treatment (SUDT) programs within five agencies in California, USA. Rasch analysis was conducted using RUMM2030 software to assess the items, their overall fit to the Rasch model, the response scale used, individual item fit, differential item functioning (DIF), and person separation.
   Results: Following a stepwise process, the scale was reduced from nine items to three items to increase the feasibility and acceptability of the scale while maintaining suitable psychometric properties. The three-item unidimensional scale showed good person separation (PSI=.872), no disordering of thresholds, and no evidence of uniform or non-uniform DIF. Rasch analysis supported the viability of the scale as a measure of implementation intentions.
   Conclusions: The Measure of Innovation-Specific Implementation Intentions (MISII) is a sound measure of providers' intentions to use a specific innovation or EBP. Future evaluation of convergent, divergent, and predictive validity are needed. The study also demonstrates the value of Rasch analysis for testing the psychometric properties of pragmatic implementation measures.

AB Background: Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been utilised globally for advancing social and economic development. As information becomes key to enlightening development initiatives, the role of mobile technology based ICT services is becoming more significant. The aim of this study was to design and implement a mHealth data model with an intention of improving mothers' knowledge of Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) services in rural environments and to remind mothers who do not have access to mobile phones to attend antenatal care.
   Methods: The methodology adopted in tins research was participatory action research. A phased approach was utilised to answer the research question. The phases were: diagnosis of the problem, action planning, action taking, evaluation and reflection. The study was conducted in Chamwino district of Dodoma region, Tanzania. Reproductive and Child Health sections of Buigiri dispensary and Chamwino health centre were purposively selected. Data were collected through key informant interviews, document review, focus group discussion and observation. Content analysis methods were utilised during analysis. Consequently, the data model was designed, implemented and evaluated.
   Results: Challenges of information dissemination in low resource settings noted in this study are: mobile phone ownership and access of mothers, vertical coordination of health services and low staffing levels of health workers. Mothers who do not own mobile phones can leverage phone ownership of community leaders, TBAs, CHWs and relatives. Tins in turn facilitates communication of health messages to mothers.
   Conclusions: Although this study was conducted in a low resource setting, mobile network coverage was good and thus SMS technology could be used. Research should be conducted on how to disseminate similar information in remote areas without mobile coverage.

AB The aim of our internet-based intervention study was to find out whether healthcare professionals can autonomously down-regulate the stress they experience at their workplace, using an established self-regulation tool called Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII). Applying MCII to reduce stress implied for our participants to repeatedly engage in a mental exercise that (1) required specifying a wish related to reducing stress, (2) identifying and imagining its most desired positive outcome, (3) detecting and imagining the obstacle that holds them back, and (4) coming up with an if-then plan on how to overcome it. We recruited on-line nurses employed at various health institutions all over Germany, and randomly assigned participants to one of three groups. In the MCII group (n = 33), participants were taught how to use this exercise via email and the participants were asked to engage in the exercise on a daily basis for a period of 3 weeks. As compared to two control groups, one being a no-treatment control group (n = 35) and the other a modified MCII group (n = 32), our experimental MCII group showed a reduced stress level and an enhanced work engagement. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the present study as well as ways to intensify MCII effects on stress reduction.

AB Background. In sub-Saharan Africa, 25.5 million people are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), representing 70% of the global total. The need for second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) is projected to increase in the next decade in keeping with the expansion of treatment provision. Outcome data are required to inform policy.
   Methods. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the virological outcomes of protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary outcome was virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL) after 48 and 96 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with PI resistance. Pooled aggregate data were analyzed using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model.
   Results. By intention-to-treat analysis, virological suppression occurred in 69.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.2%-79.3%) of patients at week 48 (4558 participants, 14 studies), and in 61.5% (95% CI, 47.2%-74.9%) at week 96 (2145 participants, 8 studies). Preexisting resistance to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) increased the likelihood of virological suppression. Major protease resistance mutations occurred in a median of 17% (interquartile range, 0-25%) of the virological failure population and increased with duration of second-line ART.
   Conclusions. One-third of patients receiving PI-based second-line ART with continued NRTI use in sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve virological suppression, although among viremic patients, protease resistance was infrequent. Significant challenges remain in implementation of viral load monitoring. Optimizing definitions and strategies for management of second-line ART failure is a research priority.

AB Background: The assessment and evaluation of practical and sustainable development of health care has become a major focus of investigation in health services research. A key challenge for researchers as well as decision-makers in health care is to understand mechanisms influencing how complex interventions work and become embedded in practice, which is significant for both evaluation and later implementation. In this study, we explored nurses' and surgeons' perspectives on performing and participating in a complex multi-centre person-centred intervention process that aimed to support patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer to feel prepared for surgery, discharge and recovery.
   Method: Data consisted of retrospective interviews with 20 professionals after the intervention, supplemented with prospective conversational data and field notes from workshops and follow-up meetings (n = 51). The data were analysed to construct patterns in line with interpretive description.
   Results: Although the participants highly valued components of the intervention, the results reveal influencing mechanisms underlying the functioning of the intervention, including multiple objectives, unclear mandates and competing professional logics. The results also reveal variations in processing the intervention focused on differences in using and talking about intervention components.
   Conclusions: The study indicates there are significant areas of ambiguity in understanding how theory-based complex clinical interventions work and in how interventions are socially constructed and co-created by professionals' experiences, assumptions about own professional practice, contextual conditions and the researchers' intentions. This process evaluation reveals insights into reasons for success or failure and contextual aspects associated with variations in outcomes. Thus, there is a need for further interpretive inquiry, and not only descriptive studies, of the multifaceted characters of complex clinical interventions and how the intervention components are actually shaped in constantly shifting contexts.

AB Background: Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are increasingly utilized as a public health strategy for strengthening health systems and have become a core component for the delivery of TB control services in India, as promoted through national policy. However, partnerships are complex systems that rely on relationships between a myriad of different actors with divergent agendas and backgrounds. Relationship is a crucial element of governance, and relationship building an important aspect of partnerships. To understand PPPs a multi-disciplinary perspective that draws on insights from social theory is needed. This paper demonstrates how social theory can aid the understanding of the complex relationships of actors involved in implementation of Public-Private Mix (PPM)-TB policy in India.
   Methods: Ethnographic research was conducted within a district in a Southern state of India over a 14 month period, combining participant observations, informal interactions and in-depth interviews with a wide range of respondents across public, private and non-government organisation (NGO) sectors.
   Results: Drawing on the theoretical insights from Bourdieu's "theory of practice" this study explores the relationships between the different actors. The study found that programme managers, frontline TB workers, NGOs, and private practitioners all had a crucial role to play in TB partnerships. They were widely regarded as valued contributors with distinct social skills and capabilities within their organizations and professions. However, their potential contributions towards programme implementation tended to be unrecognized both at the top and bottom of the policy implementation chain. These actors constantly struggled for recognition and used different mechanisms to position themselves alongside other actors within the programme that further complicated the relationships between different actors.
   Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that applying social theory can enable a better understanding of the complex relationship across public, private and NGO sectors. A closer understanding of these processes is a prerequisite for bridging the gap between field-level practices and central policy intentions, facilitating a move towards more effective partnership strategies for strengthening local health systems. The study contributes to our understanding of implementation of PPP for TB control and builds knowledge to help policy makers and programme managers strengthen and effectively implement strategies to enable stronger governance of these partnerships.

AB In this conceptual paper, we propose that both skill set development and mindset development would be desirable dimensions of negotiation training. The second dimension has received little attention thus far, but negotiation mindsets, i.e., the psychological orientations by which people approach negotiations, are likely to have a considerable influence on the outcome of negotiations. Referring to empirical and conceptual mindset studies from outside the negotiation field, we argue that developing mindsets can leverage the effectiveness of skills and knowledge, increase learning transfer, and lead to long-term behavioral changes. We introduce an integrative negotiation mindset that comprises three inclinations which complement each other: a collaborative, a curious, and a creative one. We also discuss activities that help people to develop and enhance this mindset both in and out of the classroom. Our general claim is that by moving beyond the activities of conventional negotiation training, which focuses on skills and knowledge, mindset-oriented negotiation training can increase training effectiveness and enable participants to more often reach what we define as sustainable integrative agreements.

AB In 2015, Turkey submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) before the Paris Conference of the Parties (COP 21), expressing its intention to decrease emissions level at a rate of 21% from business as usual. This emissions reduction target is important as it is the first one for Turkey. However, Turkey faces unemployment problems and needs to sustain its growth. In this study, an Environmentally Extended Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), based on 2012 Input-Output data, was created, emissions reduction potentials of the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP) together with the INDC were calculated, and alternative policies to reduce emissions to the target level and to boost the economy were proposed separately. The study finds that both the preparation and implementation of the previous national documents are problematic, and that Turkey was not meticulous about implementation of the climate mitigation policies in the previous national documents. The study also finds that reaching the emissions target with the INDC policies seems impossible and more conceivable policies are needed, and recommends that the INDC target and document itself should be revised substantially.

AB The aim of this study is to develop a theoretical framework for blockchain, operations in particular. Furthermore, we aim to identify the main drivers and barriers of digital innovation and explore the general possibilities of blockchain applications within the maritime industry. A case study approach is applied: the Norwegian offshore industry. Primary data is collected through interviews, while secondary data is collected from industrial and company reports, the Internet, and national and international media reports. We have discovered that cost reduction intentions, the high level of regulation in the maritime industry, and the large amount of data that maritime companies should process, along with the intention to work more effectively, are the main drivers of digital innovation. On the other hand, the high cost of implementation, the bad quality of Internet connections offshore, the old age of decision-makers, the technology-oriented culture, the lack of investment initiatives, the low level of blockchain diffusion through the supply chain, and risk aversion are the main barriers. The results of the qualitative study show that some of the barriers and motives of digital innovation and the introduction to blockchain technology were pointed out by earlier studies. However, we have identified several unique drivers and barriers specific to the industry. Finally, the blockchain process framework is developed.

AB This paper presents a theoretical argument that low carbon strivings - personal goals to reduce carbon footprint in the household can predict a wide range of diverse behaviours to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and reports four studies to validate Low Carbon Readiness Index (LCRI), a short, three-item measure of low carbon strivings. It is a simple and easy-to-use indicator of the general public's readiness to transition to a fully low carbon lifestyle. LCRI is associated with validated measures predicting environmentally significant reported behaviour (Study 1), multiple low carbon behavioural clusters (Study 2 & 3), and predicts reduction in actual energy use, arguably an aggregate measure of actual low carbon behaviours (Study 4). LCRI can be used to develop low carbon policies and monitor their implementation.

AB Digital behaviour change interventions, particularly those using pervasive computing technology, hold great promise in supporting users to change their behaviour. However, most interventions fail to take habitual behaviour into account, limiting their potential impact. This failure is partly driven by a plethora of overlapping behaviour change theories and related strategies that do not consider the role of habits. We critically review the main theories and models used in the research to analyse their application to designing effective habitual behaviour change interventions. We highlight the potential for Dual Process Theory, modern habit theory, and Goal Setting Theory, which together model how users form and break habits, to drive effective digital interventions. We synthesise these theories into an explanatory framework, the Habit Alteration Model, and use it to outline the state of the art. We identify the opportunities and challenges of habit-focused interventions.

AB Objective: This study aimed to better understand the implementation of cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) by exploring the impact of clinicians' attitudes toward CBTp within the Theory of Planned Behavior framework (i.e., by considering attitudes, behaviors, intention, and social norms) as well as perceived obstacles and response to proposed solutions. Method: One hundred forty-two clinicians from 2 sites in Canada and 1 site in Australia answered an online survey involving both Likert scales and open-ended questions. The role of attitudes, social norms, and behavioral control (i.e., freedom to decide or act) on intention of offering CBTp delivering CBTp were analyzed using linear and logistic regressions. Sites were compared using analysis of variance. Reponses to perceived obstacles were thematically analyzed. Results: Results were similar across settings. Entered together in the model, attitudes, social norms, and behavioral control were significant in predicting the intention of offering CBTp, F(3, 125) = 38.49, p < .001, with 49% of the variance explained, although behavioral control did not significantly contribute to the model. CBTp training (odds ratio = 0.23, confidence interval = 0.06-0.58) and social norms (odds ratio = 0.79, confidence interval = 0.68-0.93) significantly predicted CBTp delivery. Six themes that emerged regarding perceived obstacles are provided. Training, supervision, and local support were the most frequently endorsed solutions. Brief or modular CBTp and group or online delivery were also positively endorsed. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Clinicians' individual and collective attitudes should be targeted by more and better training to increase their delivery of CBTp. Given organizational barriers, CBTp-informed interventions warrant further investigation.

AB There is no doubt regarding the multiple benefits of breastfeeding for infants and society in general. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) in a conjoint effort with United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) developed the "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding" in 1992, which became the backbone of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). Following this development, many hospitals and countries intensified their position towards creating a "breastfeeding oriented" practice. Over the past two decades, the interest increased in the BFHI and the Ten Steps. However, alongside the implementation of the initiative, extensive research continues to evaluate the benefits and dangers of the suggested practices. Hence, it is our intention to make a critical evaluation of the current BFHI and the Ten Steps recommendations in consideration of the importance of providing an evidence-based breastfeeding supported environment for our mothers and infants.

AB Introduction: Evidence based medicine (EBM) is increasingly embraced by complementary and alternative medicine. Academics from China, Australia and UK developed a Summer School EBM course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) students in China.
   Methods: An action research approach was used to evaluate the effects of an international collaborative approach to improve learning and teaching. A systematic analysis of an EBM course conducted in 2015 with (66) students and (16) teacher/assistants was used to inform the 2016 course design. Before and after implementation of the 2016 course, (10) teacher/assistant and (20) student pre-/post-course survey responses were recorded to measure attitudes, knowledge and intention to apply EBM in TCM practice. Focus groups, teachers' diaries, field notes and survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data.
   Results: Changes made in the 2016 course include changing topic focus, catering for different language abilities and varying the learning format. Students and teachers found the course engaging and relevant. Chinese teachers adopted interactive teaching methods and believed they improved student engagement and learning. Teachers reported teaching EBM to TCM students in English was challenging but benefited from the experience. Students embraced the concepts of EBM and performed beyond their and their teachers' expectations.
   Conclusions: Cross-cultural collaboration in teaching a culturally challenging topic in a foreign language using unfamiliar teaching methods is demanding However, utilisation of an action research model can result in positive student evaluation and change in teacher beliefs and practice through sharing reflections and ideas.

AB Background: Brazil is currently debating the implementation of front-of-package labels. This study tested if Warning labels (WLs) improved consumer understanding, perceptions, and purchase intentions compared to Traffic-Light labels (TLLs) in 1607 Brazilian adults. Methods: In this online, randomized controlled experiment participants saw images of 10 products and answered questions twiceonce in a no-label, control condition and then again in a randomly assigned label condition. The relative differences in responses between WLs and TLLs between control and label conditions were estimated using one-way ANOVAs or Chi-square tests. Results: Presenting WLs on products compared to TLLs helped participants: (i) improve their understanding of excess nutrient content (27.0% versus 8.2%, p < 0.001); (ii) improve their ability to identify the healthier product (24.6% versus 3.3%, p < 0.001); (iii) decrease perceptions of product healthfulness; and (iv) correctly identify healthier products (14.0% versus 6.9%, p < 0.001), relative to the control condition. With WLs, there was also an increase in the percentage of people: (v) expressing an intention to purchase the relatively healthier option (16.1% versus 9.8%, p < 0.001); and (vi) choosing not to buy either product (13.0% versus 2.9%, p < 0.001), relative to the control condition. The participants in the WL condition had significantly more favorable opinions of the labels compared to those in the TLL group. Conclusions: WLs would be more effective, compared to the TLL, at improving consumer food choices.

AB Social deprivation negatively affects health outcomes but receives little attention in obstetric risk selection. We investigated whether a combination of (1) risk assessment focused on non-medical risk factors, lifestyle factors, and medical risk factors, with (2) subsequent institution of risk-specific care pathways, and (3) multidisciplinary consultation between care providers from the curative and the public health sector reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes among women in selected urban areas in the Netherlands. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial in 14 urban municipalities across the Netherlands. Prior to the randomisation, municipalities were ranked and paired according to their expected proportion of pregnant women at risk for adverse outcomes at birth. The primary outcome was delivery of a preterm and/or small for gestational age (SGA) baby, analysed with multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis adjusting for clustering and individual baseline characteristics. A total of 33 community midwife practices and nine hospitals participated throughout the study. Data from 4302 participants was included in the Intention To Treat (ITT) analysis. The intervention had no demonstrable impact on the primary outcome: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.17 (95% CI 0.84-1.63). Among the secondary outcomes, the intervention improved the detection of threatening preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction during pregnancy [aOR 1.27 (95% CI 1.01-1.61)]. Implementation of additional non-medical risk assessment and preventive strategies into general practices is feasible but did not decrease the incidence of preterm and/or SGA birth in the index pregnancy in deprived urban areas.

ID SINGLE DEMONSTRATION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL
AB Manually programming robots is difficult, impeding more widespread use of robotic systems. In response, efforts are being made to develop robots that use imitation learning. With such systems a robot learns by watching humans perform tasks. However, most imitation learning systems replicate a demonstrator's actions rather than obtaining a deeper understanding of why those actions occurred. Here we introduce an imitation learning framework based on causal reasoning that infers a demonstrator's intentions. As with imitation learning in people, our approach constructs an explanation for a demonstrator's actions, and generates a plan based on this explanation to carry out the same goals rather than trying to faithfully reproduce the demonstrator's precise motor actions. This enables generalization to new situations. We present novel causal inference algorithms for imitation learning and establish their soundness, completeness and complexity characteristics. Our approach is validated using a physical robot, which successfully learns and generalizes skills involving bimanual manipulation. Human performance on similar skills is reported. Computer experiments using the Monroe Plan Corpus further validate our approach. These results suggest that causal reasoning is an effective unifying principle for imitation learning. Our system provides a platform for exploring neural implementations of this principle in future work.

AB Staff members in residential care for youth are frequently confronted with aggressive behaviour, which has adverse effects on their stress levels and work satisfaction. This paper describes a qualitative evaluation to find out how staff members benefit from Non-violent Resistance (NVR), a method to create an aggression mitigating residential climate. Staff members were positive about NVR and reported feeling more relaxed. Most valued aspects of this method were the focus on being a team, delayed response and giving up the illusion of control. However, training and the intention to use NVR isn't enough, high quality implementation and maintenance are crucial.

As a consequence, the implementation of interventions that reduce the SES achievement gap in education may face important ideological barriers. The purpose of the present article is to test the belief in school meritocracy as one of these barriers. In three studies, participants' willingness to see an equalizing pedagogical intervention implemented in one's own university (Study 1) or in one's own children's school (Studies 2 and 3) and their intention to engage in this implementation were measured. Results indicated that a higher belief in school meritocracy (but not meritocracy endorsement, Study 1) predicted lower engagement in the implementation of an equalizing method. This is not observed for inequality-maintaining interventions (Studies 2 and 3), sustaining the role of descriptive school meritocracy in the perpetuation of social inequalities within education.

AB Aims and objectivesAs individuals in Western societies age, there is increasing demand for home-based care to help older people stay in their homes for as long as possible and provide services that ensure a person's quality of life in old age. Numerous attempts are made to develop a framework to secure quality of care. However, research has shown insufficient quality in care for older people. In this study, the purpose is to study how older people's experiences with home care reflect a person-centred approach to care. Data derived from an earlier study on ageing among home-dwelling men and women who are aged 67-91 and living in the Faroe Islands.
   BackgroundPerson-centredness as a concept is an often quoted, but ill-defined concept. Most studies concerning person-centred care are conducted within hospital wards or long-term care institutions. Empirical studies concerning home-dwelling older people receiving home care are scarce.
   MethodsThe study is a secondary analysis of data from an earlier qualitative study. Latent thematic analysis was used which meant coding issues of potential interest and collecting these codes into themes.
   ResultsThree themes appeared to combine the initial codes: sense of involvement, sense of meaningfulness and contextual conditions. Overall, the analysis showed that the users were seldom involved in planning or scheduling the care they received. What they were offered did not always make sense to them or correspond to their needs or preferences.
   ConclusionsThe number of interviews included was limited. However, findings from this study point at some possible barriers to successful implementation of person-centredness within elder care. Especially, contextual conditions seem to limit the facilitation of person-centred practices.
   Relevance to clinical practiceHealthcare providers must take the user's preferences, resources and networks into consideration when coordinating and planning home care and, importantly, be open for negotiating needs. It is important to draw attention to the contrast between political intentions regarding elder care and the limited options for putting the intentions into practice.

AB Procedural safeguards have been in place for years with the intention of protecting the rights of parents and their children with disabilities. Despite the promises of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, parents have not mastered the tools they need to be active participants in their child's special education. Educators must inform parents of children with disabilities of their rights and responsibilities in documents that clearly communicate the expectation that parents can and will advocate for their children. Review of the documents currently used to inform parents of their rights, as well as relevant literature on the topic, indicated that parents are not empowered to give informed consent. This study sought to talk directly with parents of children with disabilities to explore whether a redesigned notice of procedural safeguards document is warranted and could support parents' engagement in their child's special education. Interview data collected demonstrated that parents of children with disabilities see a need for revised documents and need functional information from the schools. The implementation of rights notices that authentically inform parents could bring about a shift in the culture of special education and include all parents as active participants in their child's special education.

AB Earlier intention-to-treat (ITT) findings from a community-randomized trial demonstrated effects of the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention system on reducing problem behaviors among youth. In ITT analyses, youth were analyzed according to their original study community's randomized condition even if they moved away from the community over the course of follow-up and received little to no exposure to intervention activities. Using inverse probability weights (IPWs), this study estimated effects of CTC in the same randomized trial among youth who remained in their original study communities throughout follow-up. Data were from the Community Youth Development Study, a community-randomized trial of 24 small towns in the United States. A cohort of 4,407 youth was followed from fifth grade (prior to CTC implementation) to eighth grade. IPWs for one's own moving status were calculated using fifth- and sixth-grade covariates. Results from inverse probability weighted multilevel models indicated larger effects for youth who remained in their study community for the first 2 years of CTC intervention implementation compared to ITT estimates. These effects included reduced likelihood of alcohol use, binge drinking, smokeless tobacco use, and delinquent behavior. These findings strengthen support for CTC as an efficacious system for preventing youth problem behaviors.

AB This study aimed to examine older adults' physical activity intentions and preferred implementation intentions, and how intentions and preferred implementation intentions differ between older, middle aged and younger adults. A cross-sectional Australian wide telephone survey of 1217 respondents was conducted in 2016. Multiple and ordinal regression analyses were conducted to compare intentions and preferred implementation intentions between older (65 +), middle aged (45-64) and younger adults (< 45). A higher percentage of older adults had no intentions to engage in regular physical activity within the next 6 months (60%) compared to younger adults (25%). Older adults' most popular preferences included being active at least once a day and for 30 min or less and were more likely to prefer more frequent and shorter sessions compared to younger adults. Both older and middle aged adults were more likely to prefer slower paced physical activity compared to younger adults who preferred fast paced physical activity. Physical activity interventions for older adults should address the high percentage of older adults with no intentions and public health campaigns for older adults should promote 30 min daily sessions of slow paced activity.

AB A major risk factor for many flood-related drownings is driving through floodwater. We aimed to understand Australian drivers' experiences and beliefs with respect to avoid driving through floodwater using the theory of planned behaviour as a framework. Study 1 (N = 23) used a qualitative design to gain an in-depth understanding of individuals' experiences with driving through floodwater. Study 2 (N = 157) used a survey-based design to identify the factors related to this behaviour including knowledge, beliefs, and social-cognitive factors. In Study 1, drivers identified a range of advantages (e.g., didn't damage car), disadvantages (e.g., inconvenient, but not so terrible), barriers (e.g., urgency to reach destination), and facilitators (e.g., making plans and using existing plans) to avoiding driving through floodwater. Normative factors were also important influences on drivers' decisions including normative expectancy, approval of significant others, and a moral obligation for the safety of others. In Study 2, participants were able to recall information about driving through floodwater (e.g., dangerous/risky) and its meaning (e.g., body of water over road). A range of experiences were described for avoiding driving through floodwater (e.g., took an alternative route). Across the studies, a range of behavioural, normative, and control beliefs were elicited. Finally, sex (women more likely), attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control significantly predicted intentions to avoid driving through floodwater, with the model explaining 55% of the variance. These findings can inform intervention targets and development of prevention strategies for effective behaviour change, saving lives otherwise lost to Australian waterways in flood.

LA English
DT Article
DE Software visualisation; Conceptual visualisation; Software process;
   Conceptual design; Feature location; Traceability, locality
AB Context: Most prior software visualisation (SV) research has focused primarily on making aspects of intangible software product artefacts more evident. While undoubtedly useful, this focus has meant that software process visualisation has received far less attention.
   Objective: This paper presents Conceptual Visualisation, a novel SV approach that builds on the well-known CodeCity metaphor by situating software code artefacts alongside their software development processes, in order to link and synchronise these typically separate components.
   Method: While the majority of prior SV research has focused on re-presenting what is already available in the code (i.e., the implementation) or information derived from it (i.e., various metrics), the presented approach instead makes the design concepts and original developers' intentions - both significant sources of information in terms of software development and maintenance - readily and contextually available in a visualisation environment that tightly integrates the code artefacts with their original functional requirements and development activity.
   Results: Our approach has been implemented in a prototype tool called ScrumCity with the proof of concept being demonstrated using six real-world open source systems. A preliminary case study has further been carried out with real world data.
   Conclusion: Conceptual Visualisation, as implemented in ScrumCity, shows early promise in enabling developers and managers (and potentially other stakeholders) to traverse and explore multiple aspects of software product and process artefacts in a synchronised manner, achieving traceability between the two.

AB Background: Young adults (18-39 years) with type 2 diabetes are at risk of early development and rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss and blindness in working-age adults. Retinal screening is key to the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, with risk of vision loss significantly reduced by timely treatment thereafter. Despite this, retinal screening rates are low among this at-risk group. The objective of this study was to develop a theoretically-grounded, evidence-based retinal screening promotion leaflet, tailored to young adults with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Utilising the six steps of Intervention Mapping, our multidisciplinary planning team conducted a mixed-methods needs assessment (Step 1); identified modifiable behavioural determinants of screening behaviour and constructed a matrix of change objectives (Step 2); designed, reviewed and debriefed leaflet content with stakeholders (Steps 3 and 4); and developed program implementation and evaluation plans (Steps 5 and 6).
   Results: Step 1 included in-depth qualitative interviews (N = 10) and an online survey that recruited a nationally-representative sample (N = 227), both informed by literature review. The needs assessment highlighted the crucial roles of knowledge (about diabetic retinopathy and screening), perception of personal risk, awareness of the approval of significant others and engagement with healthcare team, on retinal screening intentions and uptake. In Step 2, we selected five modifiable behavioural determinants to be targeted: knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs, intention, and behavioural skills. In Steps 3 and 4, the "Who is looking after your eyes?" leaflet was developed, containing persuasive messages targeting each determinant and utilising engaging, cohort-appropriate imagery. In Steps 5 and 6, we planned Statewide implementation and designed a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the leaflet.
   Conclusions: This research provides an example of a systematic, evidence-based approach to the development of a simple health intervention designed to promote uptake of screening in accordance with national guidelines. The methods and findings illustrate how Intervention Mapping can be employed to develop tailored retinal screening promotion materials for specific priority populations. This paper has implications for future program planners and is intended to assist those wishing to use Intervention Mapping to create similar theoretically-driven, tailored resources.

AB There is a perceived gap between dietary advice given by health practitioners and adherence to the advice by patients. We investigated whether a behaviour change technique (implementation-planning) was more effective than standard-of-care diet advice at reducing dietary acid intake using quantitative erosive tooth wear progression as an objective clinical outcome. This study was a randomised controlled, double-blind, single-centre clinical trial in the UK. Participants (n = 60) with high dietary acid intake (>= 2 daily), were recruited and randomly assigned (1: 1) to receive either implementation-planning or standard-of-care diet advice in a single clinical session. Questionnaires and impressions were taken at baseline and 6 months later. Dental casts were scanned using laser profilometry and superimposed using surface-matching software. Data were analysed per protocol and intention-totreat using independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. The intervention group reduced their dietary acid intake between meals to 1 intake per day compared to 2 intakes per day for the controls and demonstrated reduced dental hard tissue volume loss (-0.00 mm(3) (SD = 0.01)) compared to controls (-0.07 mm(3) (SD 0.17)), p = 0.049. This paper supports the use of implementation planning in clinical practice and presents a non-invasive method of intervention assessment in behaviour change. Larger trials are needed to confirm the generalisability of results.

AB Introduction: Severe and fatal pertussis infections are concentrated among infants who are too young to be protected through routine vaccinations. Maternal Tdap (mTdap), which is now the standard of care in the US and UK, is considered to be the most effective way to address this gap in preventative care. Little is known about how pregnant women in low-resource settings might view mTdap. To inform strategies for mTdap implementation in these contexts, public health researchers sought to understand knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward pertussis and maternal vaccines and assess the barriers to vaccine acceptance.
   Methods: We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) among mothers who participated in a longitudinal birth cohort study at the Chawama primary health center in Lusaka, Zambia, Since SAMIPS was not a clinical trial, but instead an observational cohort study, registration on clinical trials.gov was not required. Trained interviewers conducted the FGDs in January 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide, exploring participants' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward pertussis and vaccines. We analyzed the transcripts using Nvivo v.11 software.
   Results: Fifty mothers participated across 7 FGDs. Mothers had limited knowledge of pertussis and vaccines, yet expressed generally positive views of vaccinating themselves and their children. Participants conveyed very little vaccine hesitancy around maternal vaccinations, and discussed how they could protect their children's health. Mothers also highlighted barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake, which included partner involvement, feelings of maternal authority over healthcare decision-making, and community rumors about Western medicine.
   Conclusion: Mothers viewed vaccinations as an important method to keep their children healthy, despite cultural myths and misconceptions about pertussis and vaccines. FGD results suggest that vaccine acceptability is high in Zambia, which is a critical factor to vaccine uptake, A strategy addressing myths and misconceptions should be prioritized if and when mTdap is introduced across low-resource settings.

AB This paper examines how procrastinators behave differently from non-procrastinators in implementing intended behavior. By focusing on time-related attributes of behavior, we demonstrate in five studies (aggregated N = 965) that onset delay seems to be a preferred option for procrastinators in common daily situations. Thus, when an action possibility is available for intended behavior, procrastinators tend to delay behavior onset, both in actual behavior and in onset preferences, often instigating chains of events with negative consequences. We discuss possible mechanisms responsible for such delays and explore how such mechanisms generate and sustain dilatory behavior. We conclude that a better understanding of why behavioral delays occur in early phases of action implementation is of importance in understanding and preventing procrastination.

AB Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is the most common bariatric procedure in Sweden and results in substantial weight loss. Approximately one year post-surgery weight regain for these patient are common, followed by a decrease in health related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical activity (PA). Our aim is to investigate the effects of a dissonance-based intervention on HRQoL, PA and other health-related behaviors in female RYGB patients 24 months after surgery. We are not aware of any previous RCT that has investigated the effects of a similar intervention targeting health behaviors after RYGB.
   Methods: The ongoing RCT, the "WELL-GBP"-trial (wellbeing after gastric bypass), is a dissonance-based intervention for female RYGB patients conducted at five hospitals in Sweden. The participants are randomized to either control group receiving usual follow-up care, or to receive an intervention consisting of four group sessions three months post-surgery during which a modified version of the Stice dissonance-based intervention model is used. The sessions are held at the hospitals, and topics discussed are PA, eating behavior, social and intimate relationships. All participants are asked to complete questionnaires measuring HRQoL and other health-related behaviors and wear an accelerometer for seven days before surgery and at six months, one year and two years after surgery. The intention to treat and per protocol analysis will focus on differences between the intervention and control group from pre-surgery assessments to follow-up assessments at 24 months after RYGB. Patients' baseline characteristics are presented in this protocol paper.
   Discussion: A total of 259 RYGB female patients has been enrolled in the "WELL-GBP"-trial, of which 156 women have been randomized to receive the intervention and 103 women to control group. The trial is conducted within a Swedish health care setting where female RYGB patients from diverse geographical areas are represented. Our results may, therefore, be representative for female RYGB patients in the country as a whole. If the intervention is effective, implementation within the Swedish health care system is possible within the near future.

AB Background: In Cameroon, the National Tuberculosis Control Program that applies selective directly observed treatments faces difficulties in its implementation for a lack of resources, leading to only 65% of patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis being cured after 6 months of treatment This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of daily Short Message Service reminders to increase adherence and the proportion of adult tuberculosis patients cured after 6 months of treatment.
   Methods: A simple blinded, randomised controlled, multicentre study carried out in 12 Treatment and Diagnostic Centres of Yaounde. The patients included were randomly assigned to two groups: patients in the intervention group received daily SMS reminders in addition to the usual treatment; those in the control group received the usual treatment only. The primary outcomes were the number and proportion of treatment success at 5 months, and the number and proportion of patients cured at 6 months. Data analysis was by intention to treat.
   Results: Two hundred and seventy-nine participants were randomized into intervention group (n = 137) and control group (n = 142). At five months, there were 111 treatment success (81%) in the intervention group and 106 (74.6%) in the control group (OR = 1.45 [0.81, 2.56]; p = 0.203). At 6 months, there were 87 patients cured (63.5%) in the intervention group and 88 (62%) in the control group (OR = 1.06 [0.65, 1.73]; p = 0.791). The number of dropouts at 6 months was 47 (34.3%) in intervention group, and 46 (32.4%) in the control group. 48.9% (23/47) and 39. 1% (18/46) of these drop-outs were sputum-negative at 5 months. At three different appointments, there were no significant differences between the two groups in any secondary outcomes. Very high and similar satisfaction was found for general management of patients in both groups: 99.5 and 99.2% (p = 0.41).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that SMS reminders do not increase treatment success and cure proportions. However, the low proportion of patients cured at 6 month may be an underestimation due to a high dropout rate between the fifth and the sixth months of treatment Future trials should focus on reducing the dropout rate.

   PERSPECTIVES; PATHWAYS
AB Rationale: As community health interventions advance from being faith-placed to authentically faith-based, greater discussion is needed about the theory, practice, and ethics of delivering health messages embedded within a religious worldview. While there is much potential to leverage religion to promote health behaviors and improve health outcomes, there is also a risk of co-opting religious teachings for strictly biomedical ends.
   Objective: To describe the development, implementation, and ethical dimensions of a conceptual model for religiously-tailoring health messages.
   Method: We used data from 6 focus groups and 19 interviews with women aged 40 and older sampled from diverse Muslim community organizations to map out how religious beliefs and values impact mammography-related behavioral, normative and control beliefs. These beliefs were further grouped into those that enhance mammography intention (facilitators) and those that impede intention (barriers). In concert with a multi-disciplinary advisory board, and by drawing upon leading theories of health behavior change, we developed the "3R" model for crafting religiously-tailored health messages.
   Results: The 3R model addresses barrier beliefs, which are beliefs that negatively impact adopting a health behavior, by (i) reframing the belief within a relevant religious worldview, (ii) reprioritizing the belief by introducing another religious belief that has greater resonance with participants, and (iii) reforming the belief by uncovering logical flaws and/or theological misinterpretations. These approaches were used to create messages for a peer-led, mosque-based, educational intervention designed to improve mammography intention among Muslim women.
   Conclusions: There are benefits and potential ethical challenges to using religiously tailored messages to promote health behaviors. Our theoretically driven 3R model aids interventionists in crafting messages that address beliefs that hinder healthy behaviors. It is particularly useful in the context of faith-based interventions for it highlights the ethical choices that must be made when incorporating religious values and beliefs in tailored messages.

AB Personalized recommendation has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving the problem of information overload on the Internet. However, evidences show that due to the concerns of personal privacy, users' reluctance to disclose their personal information has become a major barrier for the development of personalized recommendation. In this paper, we propose to generate a group of fake preference profiles, so as to cover up the user sensitive subjects, and thus protect user personal privacy in personalized recommendation. First, we present a client-based framework for user privacy protection, which requires not only no change to existing recommendation algorithms, but also no compromise to the recommendation accuracy. Second, based on the framework, we introduce a privacy protection model, which formulates the two requirements that ideal fake preference profiles should satisfy: (1) the similarity of feature distribution, which measures the effectiveness of fake preference profiles to hide a genuine user preference profile; and (2) the exposure degree of sensitive subjects, which measures the effectiveness of fake preference profiles to cover up the sensitive subjects. Finally, based on a subject repository of product classification, we present an implementation algorithm to well meet the privacy protection model. Both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB This paper explores the attention regulation challenges brought by interruptions. In contrast to much of the research on interruptions that looks at the effects on the interrupted task, this paper examines the difficulty of focusing attention and performing well on interrupting tasks. Integrating research on attention residue, time pressure, and implementation intention, we predict that when people anticipate resuming their interrupted work under time pressure, they will find it difficult to switch their attention to the interrupting task, leading to attention residue and low performance. A ready-to-resume intervention, in which one briefly reflects on and plans one's return to the interrupted task, mitigates this effect such that attention residue is reduced and performance on the interrupting task does not suffer. Data collected across four studies support these hypotheses.

AB In agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE), the application of model-driven development (MDD) and the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) for Multi-Agent System (MAS) development are quite popular since the implementation of MAS is naturally complex, error-prone, and costly due to the autonomous and proactive properties of the agents. The internal agent behavior and the interaction within the agent organizations become even more complex and hard to implement when the requirements and interactions for the other agent environments such as the Semantic Web are considered. Hence, in this study, we propose a model-driven MAS development methodology which is based on a domain-specific modeling language (called SEA_ML) and covers the whole process of analysis, modeling, code generation and implementation of a MAS working in the Semantic Web according to the well-known Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent principles. The use of new SEA_ML-based MAS development methodology is exemplified with the development of a semantic web-enabled MAS for electronic bartering (Ebarter). Achieved results validated the generation and the development-time performance of applying this new MAS development methodology. More than half of the all agents and artifacts needed for fully implementing the E-barter MAS were automatically obtained by just using the generation features of the proposed methodology.

AB OBJECTIVE. We evaluated the feasibility of an intervention combining metacognitive strategy instruction (MSI) with training in implementation intentions for adults with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Implementation intentions are written premade decision statements specifying when, where, and how goal behaviors are to be enacted.
   METHOD. Two participants with mTBI received a six-session intervention that included setting a daily implementation intention for an occupational therapy goal. A scoring rubric was used to evaluate the quality of implementation intentions; goal achievement was measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and goal attainment scaling.
   RESULTS. All implementation intentions received perfect quality scores, suggesting participants learned to correctly craft implementation intentions. Improvements in COPM self-ratings exceeded minimal detectable change values; goal attainment levels indicated better-than-expected goal achievement.
   CONCLUSION. An intervention combining MSI and implementation intention training appears to be feasible. As an adjunct to MSI, implementation intentions may contribute to clients' ability to achieve their own occupational performance goals. Further study is needed.

AB Introduction Schools are promising settings for physical activity promotion; however, they are complex and adaptive systems that can influence the quality of programme implementation. This paper presents an evaluation of a school-based running programme (Marathon Kids). The aims of this study are (1) to identify the processes by which schools implement the programme, (2) identify and explain the contextual factors affecting implementation and explications of effectiveness and (3) examine the relationship between the level of implementation and perceived outcomes.
   Methods Using a realist evaluation framework, a mixed method single-group before-and-after design, strengthened by multiple interim measurements, will be used. Year 5 (9-10 years old) pupils and their teachers will be recruited from six state-funded primary schools in Leicestershire, UK. Data will be collected once prior to implementation, at five discrete time points during implementation and twice following implementation. A weekly implementation log will also be used. At time point 1 (TP1) (September 2016), data on school environment, teacher and pupil characteristics will be collected. At TP1 and TP6 (July 2017), accelerometry, pupil self-reported physical activity and psychosocial data (eg, social support and intention to be active) will be collected. At TP2, TP3 and TP5 (January, March and June 2017), observations will be conducted. At TP2 and TP5, there will be teacher interviews and pupil focus groups. Follow-up teacher interviews will be conducted at TP7 and TP8 (October 2017 and March 2018) and pupil focus group at TP8. In addition, synthesised member checking will be conducted (June 2018) with a mixed sample of schools.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study was obtained through Loughborough University Human Participants Ethics Subcommittee (R16-P032 & R16-P116). Findings will be disseminated via print, online media and dissemination events as well as practitioner and/or research journals.

AB Environmental awareness and changing attitudes toward "green consumption" are becoming evident in emerging countries' markets. Using an extended theory of planned behavior, this paper aims to examine emerging countries' business students' intentions to purchase green vehicles. Stratified random sampling was used to select study participants, and data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Results revealed that environmental knowledge and awareness have a significant influence on business students' favorable attitudes toward green vehicles. Further, a significant association between attitudes toward green vehicles, perceived behavioral controls, and intentions to purchase green vehicles was observed. Findings serve to inform managers and policy makers who are formulating strategies for maximizing value creation in an era of increasingly environmentally aware consumers in emerging markets. Ultimately, this policy will help to promote green technology initiatives, and encourage higher rates of adoption of eco-friendly vehicles in emerging countries.

AB The success of sustainable building renovation is inevitably dependent on the capabilities of the involved stakeholders throughout the entire project. Therefore, any building client with intentions of sustainable building renovations must reflect on sourcing the adequate capabilities for a sustainable renovation project. The question in focus is: how to facilitate a sourcing strategy for energy-efficient sustainable building renovation and maintenance. This study on energy efficiency implementations shows that even in developed countries like Sweden, where energy efficiency is regulated by the EU, national legislation and other public policies, the municipal facilities management organizations need process guidance to navigate in decisions regarding in-house capabilities and collaboration with external service providers. A dialogue tool for the sourcing process, the energy efficiency maturity matrix, is developed to support future sourcing processes for energy-efficient buildings as a prominent part of the broader field of sustainable building renovation and maintenance. The future will show when building clients to a larger extent will embrace sourcing strategies instead of mainly focusing on specific technical improvements. The new International standards for facilities management (ISO18480 series) might support this change process, as it includes a sourcing approach, from a strategic level to an operational level, to add more value and to optimize costs.

AB Indigenous Australians are under-represented in the health workforce. The shortfall in the Indigenous health workforce compounds the health disparities experienced by Indigenous Australians and places pressure on Indigenous health professionals. This systematic review aims to identify enablers and barriers to the retention of Indigenous Australians within the health workforce and to describe strategies to assist with development and retention of Indigenous health professionals after qualification. Four electronic databases were systematically searched in August 2017. Supplementary searches of relevant websites were also undertaken. Articles were screened for inclusion using pre-defined criteria and assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Fifteen articles met the criteria for inclusion. Important factors affecting the retention of Indigenous health professionals included work environment, heavy workloads, poorly documented/understood roles and responsibilities, low salary and a perception of salary disparity, and the influence of community as both a strong personal motivator and source of stress when work/life boundaries could not be maintained. Evidence suggests that retention of Indigenous health professionals will be improved through building supportive and culturally safe workplaces; clearly documenting and communicating roles, scope of practice and responsibilities; and ensuring that employees are appropriately supported and remunerated. The absence of intervention studies highlights the need for deliberative interventions that rigorously evaluate all aspects of implementation of relevant workforce, health service policy, and practice change.

AB Objectives To assess the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a weight management (WM) programme for overweight patients with a family history (FH) of breast cancer (BC) or colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Study design A two-arm (intervention vs usual care) randomised controlled trial.
   Setting National Health Service (NHS) Tayside and NHS Grampian.
   Participants People with a FH of BC or CRC aged >= 18 years and body mass index of >= 25 kg/m(2) referred to NHS genetic services.
   Intervention Participants were randomised to a control (lifestyle booklet) or 12-week intervention arm where they were given one face-to-face counselling session, four telephone consultations and web-based support. A goal of 5% reduction in body weight was set, and a personalised diet and physical activity (PA) programme was provided. Behavioural change techniques (motivational interviewing, action and coping plans and implementation intentions) were used.
   Primary outcome Feasibility measures: recruitment, programme implementation, fidelity measures, achieved measurements and retention, participant satisfaction assessed by questionnaire and qualitative interviews.
   Secondary outcomes Measured changes in weight and PA and reported diet and psychosocial measures between baseline and 12-week follow-up.
   Results Of 480 patients approached, 196 (41%) expressed interest in the study, and of those, 78 (40%) patients were randomised. Implementation of the programme was challenging within the time allotted and fidelity to the intervention modest (62%). Qualitative findings indicated the programme was well received. Questionnaires and anthropometric data were completed by >98%. Accelerometer data were attained by 84% and 54% at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Retention at 12 weeks was 76%. Overall, 36% of the intervention group (vs 0% in control) achieved 5% weight loss. Favourable increases in PA and reduction in dietary fat were also reported.
   Conclusions A lifestyle programme for people with a family history of cancer is feasible to conduct and acceptable to participants, and indicative results suggest favourable outcomes.

AB Introduction Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a healthcare quality problem associated with increased costs and poor health outcomes. Identifying interventions to improve patients' successful transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a continued challenge.
   Methods and analysis This is a single-centre pragmatic randomised and controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a discharge follow-up phone call to reduce 30-day inpatient readmissions. Our primary endpoint is inpatient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge censored for death analysed with an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary endpoints included observation status readmission within 30 days, time to readmission, all-cause emergency department revisits within 30 days, patient satisfaction (measured as mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores) and 30-day mortality. Exploratory endpoints include the need for assistance with discharge plan implementation among those randomised to the intervention arm and reached by the study nurse, and the number of call attempts to achieve successful intervention delivery. Consistent with the Learning Healthcare System model for clinical research, timeliness is a critical quality for studies to most effectively inform hospital clinical practice. We are challenged to apply pragmatic design elements in order to maintain a high-quality practicable study providing timely results. This type of prospective pragmatic trial empowers the advancement of hospital-wide evidence-based practice directly affecting patients.
   Ethics and dissemination Study results will inform the structure, objective and function of future iterations of the hospital's discharge follow-up phone call programme and be submitted for publication in the literature.

AB ObjectiveCognitive support technologies that support clinical decisions and practices in the emergency department (ED) have the potential to optimize patient care. However, limited uptake by clinicians can prevent successful implementation. A better understanding of acceptance of these technologies from the clinician perspective is needed. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize diverse, emerging evidence on clinicians' acceptance of point-of-care (POC) cognitive support technology in the ED.
   MethodWe systematically searched 10 electronic databases and gray literature published from January 2006 to December 2016. Studies of any design assessing an ED-based POC cognitive support technology were considered eligible for inclusion. Studies were required to report outcome data for technology acceptance. Two reviewers independently screened studies for relevance and quality. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. A descriptive analysis of the features of POC cognitive support technology for each study is presented, illustrating trends in technology development and evaluation. A thematic analysis of clinician, technical, patient, and organizational factors associated with technology acceptance is also presented.
   ResultsOf the 1,563 references screened for eligibility, 24 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most studies were published from 2011 onward (88%), scored high for methodologic quality (79%), and examined POC technologies that were novel and newly introduced into the study setting (63%). Physician use of POC technology was the most commonly studied (67%). Technology acceptance was frequently conceptualized and measured by factors related to clinician attitudes and beliefs. Experience with the technology, intention to use, and actual use were also more common outcome measures of technology acceptance. Across studies, perceived usefulness was the most noteworthy factor impacting technology acceptance, and clinicians generally had positive perceptions of the use of POC cognitive support technology in the ED. However, the actual use of POC cognitive support technology reported by clinicians was lowuse, by proportion of patient cases, ranged from 30% to 59%. Of the 24 studies, only two studies investigated acceptance of POC cognitive support technology currently implemented in the ED, offering real-world clinical practice data. All other studies focused on acceptance of novel technologies. Technical aspects such as an unfriendly user interface, presentation of redundant or ambiguous information, and required user effort had a negative impact on acceptance. Patient expectations were also found to have a negative impact, while patient safety implications had a positive impact. Institutional support was also reported to impact technology acceptance.
   ConclusionsFindings from this scoping review suggest that while ED clinicians acknowledge the utility and value of using POC cognitive support technology, actual use of such technology can be low. Further, few studies have evaluated the acceptance and use of POC technologies in routine care. Prospective studies that evaluate how ED clinicians appraise and consider POC technology use in clinical practice are now needed with diverse clinician samples. While this review identified multiple factors contributing to technology acceptance, determining how clinician, technical, patient, and organizational factors mediate or moderate acceptance should also be a priority.

ID INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; IMPACT
AB AimTo describe how registered nurse work motivation, attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control influence intention to promote physical activity in hospitalised adult liver transplant recipients.
   DesignDescriptive study of clinical registered nurses caring for recipients of liver transplant at a tertiary medical centre.
   MethodsIntent to Mobilise Liver Transplant Recipient Scale, Work Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation Scale, and demographics were used to explore registered nurses' work motivation, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention to promote physical activity of hospitalised adult liver transplant recipients during the acute postoperative phase. Data analysis included demographics, comparison between scale items and analysis of factors predicting intent to mobilise.
   ResultsFactors predictive of intention to promote physical activity after liver transplant included appropriate knowledge to mobilise patients (R-2=.40) and identification of physical activity as nursing staff priority (R-2=.15) and responsibility (R-2=.03).
   Discussion/Implications for Nursing ManagementWhen implementing an early mobilisation protocol after the liver transplant, education on effects of physical activity in the immediate postoperative period are essential to promote implementation in practice. Nursing care environment and leadership must be supportive to ensure mobility is a registered nurse priority and responsibility. Nursing managers can leverage results to implement a mobility protocol.

TI Health insurance coverage with or without a nurse-led task shifting
   strategy for hypertension control: A pragmatic cluster randomized trial
   in Ghana
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGH BLOOD-PRESSURE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; PRIMARY-CARE; MANAGEMENT
AB Background
   Poor access to care and physician shortage are major barriers to hypertension control in sub-Saharan Africa. Implementation of evidence-based systems-level strategies targeted at these barriers are lacking. We conducted a study to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of provision of health insurance coverage (HIC) alone versus a nurse-led task shifting strategy for hypertension control (TASSH) plus HIC on systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Ghana.
   Methods and findings
   Using a pragmatic cluster randomized trial, 32 community health centers within Ghana's public healthcare system were randomly assigned to either HIC alone or TASSH + HIC. A total of 757 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were recruited between November 28, 2012, and June 11, 2014, and followed up to October 7, 2016. Both intervention groups received health insurance coverage plus scheduled nurse visits, while TASSH + HIC comprised cardiovascular risk assessment, lifestyle counseling, and initiation/titration of antihypertensive medications for 12 months, delivered by trained nurses within the healthcare system. The primary outcome was change in SBP from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included lifestyle behaviors and blood pressure control at 12 months and sustainability of SBP reduction at 24 months. Of the 757 patients (389 in the HIC group and 368 in the TASSH + HIC group), 85% had 12-month data available (60% women, mean BP 155.9/89.6 mm Hg). In intention-to-treat analyses adjusted for clustering, the TASSH + HIC group had a greater SBP reduction (-20.4 mm Hg; 95% CI -25.2 to -15.6) than the HIC group (-16.8 mm Hg; 95% CI -19.2 to -15.6), with a statistically significant between-group difference of -3.6 mm Hg (95% CI -6.1 to -0.5; p = 0.021). Blood pressure control improved significantly in both groups (55.2%, 95% CI 50.0% to 60.3%, for the TASSH + HIC group versus 49.9%, 95% CI 44.9% to 54.9%, for the HIC group), with a non-significant betweengroup difference of 5.2% (95% CI -1.8% to 12.4%; p = 0.29). Lifestyle behaviors did not change appreciably in either group. Twenty-one adverse events were reported (9 and 12 in the TASSH + HIC and HIC groups, respectively). The main study limitation is the lack of cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the additional costs and benefits, if any, of the TASSH + HIC group.
   Conclusions
   Provision of health insurance coverage plus a nurse-led task shifting strategy was associated with a greater reduction in SBP than provision of health insurance coverage alone, among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Ghana. Future scale-up of these systemslevel strategies for hypertension control in sub-Saharan Africa requires a cost-benefit analysis.

AB Aims: We assessed the effectiveness of a Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) prevention programme in routine primary health care (PHC) in high-risk patients.
   Methods: Phase IV cluster clinical trial involving 14 PHC centres in the Basque Health Service were randomised to the DE-PLAN educational healthy lifestyle promotion programme or standard care. All non-diabetic 45- to 70-year-old PHC attendees considered at high risk of T2D (FINDRISC >= 14 points) were eligible. The primary outcome was the 24-month cumulative incidence of T2D confirmed by oral glucose tolerance testing. Secondary outcomes were self-reported physical activity and dietary changes at 12 months in a subsample.
   Results: Of the 4170 patients screened, 2128 (51%) were considered high risk, but 355 (33%) and 459 (43.6%) refused to participate in the control and intervention groups, respectively. Of all eligible non-diabetic patients, 634 and 454 were included in the control and intervention arms, 545 (85.9%) and 411 (90.5%) completed the follow-up. Intention-to-treat cumulative incidences of T2D were 12.1% (77/634) in the control group and 8.4% (38/454) in intervention group, with an absolute difference of 3.8% (95% CI: 0.18%-7.4%, p = 0.045) and a relative risk reduction of 32% (0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.99, p = 0.048) in favour of the intervention. Intervention patients were 1.83-fold more likely to meet recommended physical activity levels at 12 months (95% CI: 1.06-3.17, p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: The DE-PLAN programme was effective in reducing T2D incidence in PHC high-risk patients. Research on implementation strategies to improve its feasible and sustainable adoption, reach and public health impact is warranted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NATURAL SCENE IMAGES; HYBRID APPROACH
AB The intention behind this research is to present an original work undertaken for Arabic character extraction and recognition for attaining higher percentage of recognition rate. Copious techniques for character, text extraction were proposed in earlier decades, but very few of them shed light on Arabic character set. From literature survey, it was found that 100% recognition rate is not attained by earlier proposed implementations. The proposed technique is novel and is based on traversing of the characters in a given text and marking their directions viz. North-South (NS), East-West (EW), North East-South West (NE-SW), North West-South East (NW-SE) etc., in an array and comparing them with the pre-defined codes of every character in the dataset. The experiments were conducted on Arabic news videos, documents taken from Arabic Printed Text Image (APTI) database and the results achieved from this research are very promising with a recognition rate of 98.1%. The proposed algorithm in this research work can replace the existing algorithms used in present Arabic Optical Character Recognition (AOCR) systems.

   ACTIVATION
AB Episodic simulation is an adaptive process that can support goal-directed activity and planning success. We investigated the neural architecture associated with the episodic simulation improvement to the likelihood of carrying out future actions by isolating the brain regions associated with this facilitation in a prospective memory paradigm. Participants performed a lexical decision task by making word/non-word judgments, with rarely occurring prospective memory target words requiring a pre-specified manual response. Prior to scanning, participants were given exposure to two lists of prospective memory targets: animals and tools. In a fully counterbalanced design, participants generated a rhyme to one target list and imagined their subsequent encounter (episodic simulation) with target words on the other list. Replicating prior behavioral work, episodic simulation improved subsequent prospective memory performance. Brain activation was assessed in a multivariate partial least squares analysis. Relative to lexical decision blocks with no prospective memory demand, sustained prospective memory replicated prior observations of frontal polar activation. Critically, maintaining the intention to respond to simulated targets, over and above rhyme targets, engaged middle frontal and angular gyri, and medial parietal and prefrontal cortices. Transient activity associated with prospective memory target hits revealed activation for simulated targets in medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal lobe and inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, rhyme target hits engaged more left lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. Episodic simulation, thus effectively shifts executive control strategy and boosts task performance. These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence implicating executive control and default network region interactions in adaptive, goal-directed behavior.

AB Objective: To examine cultural and socioenvironmental factors that affect breastfeeding initiation among African American women.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive design and conventional content analysis.
   Setting: A large, inner-city, primary care center affiliated with a 500-bed children's hospital within a large, Northeastern U.S. city.
   Participants: Participants were 34 U.S.-born African American mothers of healthy term infants 0 to 3 months of age.
   Methods: Six focus groups were conducted using a 16-question, scripted interview guide.
   Results: A number of complex factors that influenced breastfeeding initiation included certain cultural beliefs about sexuality, the influence of family and peer networks, information sources, intentions, and a variety of other barriers and facilitators.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the decision to initiate breastfeeding is not solely determined by the woman within the African American community. Because this decision is contingent on multiple factors external to the woman, it is important to recognize the role that partners, grandmothers, communities, information sources, and health care providers/organizations play in women's decisions. Implementation of multilevel strategies is critical to increase breastfeeding initiation among African American mothers.

AB Introduction: Despite legal protections for young workers in Canada, youth aged 15-24 are at high risk of traumatic occupational injury. While many injury prevention initiatives targeting young workers exist, the challenge faced by youth advocates and employers is deciding what aspect(s) of prevention will be the most effective focus for their efforts. A review of the academic and grey literatures was undertaken to compile the metrics-both the indicators being evaluated and the methods of measurement-commonly used to assess injury prevention programs for young workers. Metrics are standards of measurement through which efficiency, performance, progress, or quality of a plan, process, or product can be assessed.
   Methods: A PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) framework was used to develop search terms. Medline, PubMed, OVID, EMBASE, CCOHS, PsychINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC, Google Scholar and the grey literature were searched for articles in English, published between 1975-2015. Two independent reviewers screened the resulting list and categorized the metrics in three domains of injury prevention: Education, Environment and Enforcement.
   Results: Of 174 acquired articles meeting the inclusion criteria, 21 both described and assessed an intervention. Half were educational in nature (N=11). Commonly assessed metrics included: knowledge, perceptions, self-reported behaviours or intentions, hazardous exposures, injury claims, and injury counts. One study outlined a method for developing metrics to predict injury rates.
   Conclusion: Metrics specific to the evaluation of young worker injury prevention programs are needed, as current metrics are insufficient to predict reduced injuries following program implementation. One study, which the review brought to light, could be an appropriate model for future research to develop valid leading metrics specific to young workers, and then apply these metrics to injury prevention programs for youth.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of the life goal-focused brief intervention, or the so-called the goal-focused self-regulation program (GFSRP), for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD).
   Methods The GFSRP was developed as an 8-week group-program, which is based on a wide range of self-regulation theories, such as goal setting and implementation intentions. Patients with AUD (n=50) took part in the GFSRP and were compared to the control group (n=48). This study examined the changes in outcome measures from baseline to follow-up (12-week) in a mixed design.
   Results The GFSRP group had higher scores for the abstinence self-efficacy in negative affect situations than the control group at the post-test. In addition, it showed greater scores of optimisms compared to the control group. Furthermore, in the GFSRP group, there was no difference in intrinsic life goals from baseline to the 12-week follow-up, whereas the control group showed a significant decrease.
   Conclusion The GFSRP could increase the abstinence self-efficacy and optimism among patients with AUD. Moreover, it might prevent loss of life-goals as core factors in self-regulation among patients with AUD.

AB Background and Aim: Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) shows higher R0 resection and lower local recurrence rates than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in Japan. In Europe, independent learning of ESD in the colorectum is feasible, but yet to be analyzed for curative resection and recurrence rates.
   Methods: After experimental training under supervision by Japanese experts (T.O., N.Y.), three endoscopists independently carried out 83 ESD procedures intention-to-treat for lesions in the entire colorectum of 67 patients in a prospective registry (November 2009 to June 2016).
   Results: ESD was feasible in 80 (96%) colorectal neoplasias (mean diameter 33.6 [+/- 1.8] mm), and three more required conversion to piecemeal EMR. The lesions were adenomas in 66% with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), 29% with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and 5% with carcinomas (G2, pT1). ESD had to be facilitated by the final use of snaring (hybrid-ESD, n = 45), especially in the initial learning period. En-bloc resection rate was 85%. Complications were microperforations (7%, conducive to one hemicolectomy), and delayed bleeding (1%) without mortality or long-term morbidity. Residual adenomas with LGIN (5%) after hybrid-ESD did not recur after endoscopic ablation. All malignant neoplasias (34%) were curatively resected without recurrence after a mean follow up of 19.5 (+/- 3.2) months.
   Conclusions: During independent ESD learning in the colorectum, ESD intention-to-treat showed a low recurrence rate after appropriate training, and hybrid-ESD showed acceptable complication and recurrence rates, justifying hybrid-ESD as a strategy for self-completion and rescue.

TI Naloxone rescheduling in Australia: Processes, implementation and

DE naloxone; pharmacy; overdose; rescheduling; prevention
ID TAKE-HOME NALOXONE; OPIOID OVERDOSE; HEROIN OVERDOSE; PREVENTION;
   PROGRAMS; CRITERIA; SAFETY; ACCESS
AB IssuesNumerous studies and systematic reviews have concluded that naloxone for take-home use is an effective intervention to reduce overdose morbidity and mortality, with few side effects and no abuse potential. One barrier to supply is that naloxone has traditionally been a prescription medication. In May 2015, the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia announced the intention to down-schedule naloxone when used for the treatment of opioid overdose, enabling sale in pharmacies without a prescription. The aim of this article is to describe process of rescheduling of naloxone and some of the challenges observed.
   ApproachWe describe the process of rescheduling from initial proposal development to gaining support and submissions from a range of individuals and professional bodies to support this change. The implications of the change, particularly for pharmacy supply of naloxone, are discussed, including next steps to facilitate implementation of this change in the Australian context.
   Key FindingsA submission to reschedule naloxone was successfully instigated by a member of the public. The change may help remove access barriers to naloxone by allowing pharmacist supply. Cost, pharmacist training, existing naloxone formulation, presentation and packaging remain challenges to address.
   Implications and ConclusionNaloxone down-scheduling has opened up an additional way to supply naloxone through community pharmacy. Further expansion of naloxone availability may be achieved through addressing cost as a barrier, and making naloxone more widely accessible through needle syringe programs, and other services that do not have medical staff.

AB Emerging anthelmintic resistance emphasizes the need for sustainable control approaches against gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections in cattle. The uptake of diagnostic methods for sustainable control could enable more informed treatments and reduce excessive anthelmintic use. Unfortunately, the adoption of such methods remains relatively poor. A better understanding of farmers' motivations and behaviour would help to develop applicable advises and communication strategies for sustainable worm control strategies. A previous study created a general model for adoption intention of GIN diagnostics on dairy farms and measured the most important factors driving this intention (Vande Velde et al., 2015). The current research aimed to dig deeper into this model for the beliefs underlying these factors, and to identify additional factors impelling this specific behaviour. Data were collected through 22 semi-structured interviews with dairy farmers. Using analytic induction analysis, data were moved between deduction and induction. Results show that the adoption process of diagnostic methods for GIN occurs through three different phases: adoption intention, actual adoption and maintenance. Low infection awareness and low priority ('top of mind') of the disease are important barriers for adopting sustainable GIN control. Secondly, fanner behaviour is guided by two important social norms: the opinion of their veterinarian and their fellow farmers. However, farmers hold an incongruent relationship with both norms throughout different stages of behaviour: they do not value other farmers' opinions as a positive reference (intention phase), but follow and mimic their behaviour as a group (action phase). The veterinarian is seen as the most important positive reference, but also the responsible actor for GIN control. As such, the farmers do not hold themselves responsible for implementing sustainable control strategies. Thirdly, different types of motivations influence different sorts of behaviours. Sustainable behaviour such as use of diagnostics will be influenced by moral motives, while management behaviour such as treatment is raised by more economic motives. Finally, not only performing, but also maintaining behaviour is important to fully address the adoption of sustainable control. As such, to maintain the adoption on farm, planning could be an important contribution. These insights can be used by animal health organizations and industry by exploiting motivations, social norms and planning to encourage the uptake of diagnostic approaches in GIN control.

This article provides a review and synthesis of the vast and varied research on personal goals. A growing body of research shows that goals are best conceptualized as a distinct unit of analysis, with extensive within-person variations in both goal characteristics and attainment. In this article, the authors review existing literature on personal goals, examining the process of goal pursuit from start to finish, including goal setting, goal pursuit and self-regulation, and the outcomes associated with attainment and/or failure. They also address the many aspects of personal goal pursuit that are still poorly understood, highlighting directions for future research.

AB Background: Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second and third most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and men, respectively. Objectives: The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a health education intervention on the current level of Jordanians' CRC knowledge, health perceptions, and screening practices. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to recruit a sample of 197 average-risk Jordanian adults aged 50 to 75 years. The sample was collected from outpatient departments of Jordan University and Al-Basheer Hospitals in Amman. This study used quasi-experimental design, and a rolling enrollment method was implemented to randomly assign the participants into intervention and control groups. Results: Baseline results indicated that Jordanian average-risk participants were not well informed about CRC and screening recommendations. One-fourth perceived themselves to be susceptible to CRC. About one-third comprehended the seriousness of CRC, most recognized the benefits of CRC screening, and fewer than half believed there were barriers preventing them from participating in CRC screening. Four weeks after intervention implementation, there was a significantly higher level of knowledge, as well as increased susceptibility and severity perceptions, screening via fecal occult blood test, and intentions to undergo screening via colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Conclusion: The findings support the implementation of a health education intervention as an effective way to enhance levels of knowledge and promote positive health perceptions regarding CRC and screening recommendations. Implications for Practice: This study may provide Jordanian and other nurses with a theory-based educational intervention to improve the quality of nursing care and reduce costs.

AB The disease and treatment-related burdens of cancer are usually associated with a significant decrease in the quality of life of those affected. Due to the widespread use of the Internet in German households, oncological eHealth offers are a quick and easily accessible source of healthcare support for patients and their relatives. Programs for healthcare professionals include, e.g. information portals that prepare clinicians for the needs of cancer patients. The development of smartphone Apps seems to be the most promising concept for future eHealth programs.
   The article describes eHealth programs in oncology, especially with respect to form and content, utilization and effectiveness.
   Many studies in the literature have evaluated the process and outcome of eHealth interventions; however, there continues to be a need for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be able to make more accurate statements about the effectiveness of the support programs. Frequently reported problems with eHealth programs are high drop-out rates and better implementation of study-proven approaches into the daily healthcare system. Including potential stakeholders in the program development process could be helpful in reducing the high drop-out rates and usability issues and ensuring that offers match patients' needs.

AB Background: In South Africa, inequitable access to healthcare information has made many young people with limited resources more vulnerable to health risks. Mobile phones present a unique opportunity to address this problem due to the high penetration of mobile phones in South Africa and the popularity of these devices among young adults. Objective: This research sought to examine the adoption of mobile phones to access health information among students at a traditional university in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Method: A cross-sectional survey approach was used to collect information from a convenience sample of 202 university students (58 males; 104 females), the majority (71.3%) of whom were aged between 18 and 27 years and of Black African ethnicity (75.2%). The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) framework formed the theoretical foundation for the questionnaire. A research model was developed to test the hypotheses that behavioural intention to use a mobile phone to access health information would be influenced by: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived effort, social influence (SI), attitude towards technology (AT) and mobile phone experience. Results: Factor analyses indicated that the research model explained 36% of the variance in behavioural intention to use mobile devices to search for health-related queries, with PU being the largest predictor, followed by mobile experience, SI, and AT. Perceived effort did not make a statistically significant contribution.Conclusion: Using mobile phones to disseminate health information to students is a useful, convenient, and cost-effective health-promotion strategy. This research has contributed to the body of knowledge concerning the applicability of the UTAUT framework to study the adoption of technology and provided useful information to guide future research and implementation of mHealth initiatives.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study is to extend prior research on barriers to use of a prescription drug monitoring program by examining psychosocial correlates of intended use among physicians and pharmacists.& para;& para;Methods: Overall, 1,904 California physicians and pharmacists responded to a statewide survey (24.1% response rate) from August 2016 to January 2017. Participants completed an online survey examining attitudes toward prescription drug misuse and abuse, prescribing practices, prescription drug monitoring program design and ease of use, professional obligations, and normative beliefs regarding prescription drug monitoring program use. Data were analyzed in 2017. & para;& para;Results: Perceived prescription drug monitoring program usefulness and normative beliefs fully mediated the relationship between concern about prescription drug abuse and intentions to use the prescription drug monitoring program. Clinicians' sense of professional and moral obligation to use the prescription drug monitoring program was unrelated to intention to use the prescription drug monitoring program despite a positive relationship with concern about misuse and abuse. Compared with physicians, pharmacists reported greater concern about prescription drug misuse, greater professional and moral obligation to use prescription drug monitoring program, and greater rating of prescription drug monitoring program usefulness.& para;& para;Conclusions: Interventions that target normative beliefs surrounding prescription drug monitoring program use and how to use prescription drug monitoring programs effectively are likely to be more effective than those that target professional obligations or moralize to the medical community.

AB Self-affirmation may reduce defensive processing towards health messages. We tested the effects of a self-affirmation implementation intentional intervention with regard to salt risk message acceptance, estimates of daily-recommended intake and self-reported intake. Participants (n = 65) who consumed over 6 g/day of salt were randomised into three conditions: self-affirmation, self-affirming implementation intention and control. Participants attended the laboratory and completed a 2-week follow-up. There was no effect of the condition on message acceptance, salt estimation and 2-week salt intake. Across conditions, 2-week salt intake was reduced. We found no evidence for either intervention with regard to salt risk message acceptance and behaviour change.

AB The USA has high teen pregnancy rates compared to other developed nations. Many community-based organizations need assistance conducting evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs (EBPs) appropriately. This study evaluated the impact of an implementation support intervention called Getting To Outcomes (GTO) designed to help such organizations. This cluster randomized controlled trial compared 16 Boys and Girls Clubs (BGCs) implementing a teen pregnancy prevention EBP called Making Proud Choices for two years, with 16 BGCs implementing MPC augmented with GTO training, tools, and technical assistance. Participating middle school youth were compared on proximal outcomes (knowledge, attitudes, and intentions about sex and condoms from baseline to post) and sexual behaviors (frequency of sex and condom use, from baseline to 6-month follow-up). In year 1, there were no significant effects of GTO for any proximal outcome. After GTO-stimulated quality improvement in year 2, the GTO group improved significantly more on condom attitudes and use intentions. Frequency of sex and condom use did not differ between the two groups in either year; however, base rates of these behaviors in the sample were very low. Findings suggest that in typical community-based settings, detailed manuals and training common to structured EBPs may be sufficient to yield some improvement in key proximal outcomes, but that more systematic implementation support is needed to achieve greater improvement in these outcomes. Using GTO with many communities, as currently supported by various federal agencies, could yield public health impact via improvements in condom attitudes and use intentions.

AB ObjectivesWith 60-90% of children worldwide reportedly experiencing dental caries, poor oral health in the younger years is a major public health issue. As parents are important to children's oral hygiene practices, we examined the key self-regulatory behaviours of parents for supervising their children's toothbrushing using the health action process approach.
   Design and methodParticipants (N=281, 197 mothers) comprised Australian parents of 2- to 5-year-olds. A longitudinal design was used to investigate the sequential mediation chain for the effect of intention (Time 1) on parental supervision for their youngest child's toothbrushing (Time 3), via self-efficacy and planning (Time 2), and action control (Time 3).
   ResultsA latent-variable structural equationmodel, controlling for baseline behaviour and habit, revealed significant indirect effects from intention via self-efficacy and action control and intention via planning and action control, on parental supervision behaviour. The model was a good fit to the data, explaining 74% of the variance in parents' supervising behaviour for their children's toothbrushing.
   ConclusionWhile national recommendations are provided to guide parents in promoting good oral hygiene practices with their children, current results show the importance of going beyond simple knowledge transmission to support parents' intentions to supervise their children's toothbrushing actually materialize. Current findings make a significant contribution to the cumulative empirical evidence regarding self-regulatory components in health behaviour change and can inform intervention development to increase parents' participation in childhood oral hygiene practices, thus helping to curb rising oral health conditions and diseases.
   What is already known on this subject?
   Self-regulatory skills are important to translate intentions into behaviour. Self-efficacy, planning, and action control are key self-regulatory skills for behaviour change.
   What does this study add?
   Self-regulatory skills are needed for parents to supervise their children's toothbrushings. Self-efficacy, planning, and action control are important self-regulatory skills in this context. Future interventions should map these self-regulatory predictors onto behaviour change techniques.

AB BACKGROUNDSchool-based interventions can result in profound social, behavioral, and academic improvement for students with autism, but teachers rarely implement them. It is important to understand why this occurs and use this information to increase the use of evidence-based practices. Toward this goal, 2 proof-of-construct studies demonstrate the theoretical and methodological advantages of measuring behavioral intentions to use specific practices.
   METHODSTwo observational studies enrolled public school teachers who work with students with autism. The studies measure the strength of teachers' intentions to use each of 4 different evidence-based practices, assess variability in intentions, and test whether intentions predict future teacher behavior.
   RESULTSIn adjusted analyses, intentions to use a specific evidence-based practice were strongly associated with subsequent use (adjusted odds ratio = 5.2). The proportion of teachers who reported strong intentions varied from a low of 33% to a high of 66%, depending on the practice.
   CONCLUSIONSThe findings illustrate that the strength of intentions, which varies depending on the specific practice, can predict implementation. More generally, the studies demonstrate how measures of intention can aid efforts to identify implementation barriers. The approach taken can be applied to study implementation of any practices designed to improve student health.

AB Community-based management and participatory monitoring of natural resources have been advocated as better strategies because they are cheaper than externally-driven alternatives and promote pro-environmental behaviors. However, the successful implementation and sustainability of such initiatives depends on resource users' willingness to engage. Some studies claim that resource users will only participate and invest their time in management when the financial benefits received exceed the costs. However, evidence suggests that people cooperate and may volunteer even when not directly rewarded. We evaluated whether economic benefits earned from resource exploitation or cooperative behavior better explained the likelihood of peoples voluntary participation in monitoring. We studied an Amazonian forest community in Brazil, who harvested and traded a commercially-important non-timber forest product (NTFP), and gathered data using the following procedures: a survey applied to 166 adults in order to estimate peoples NTFP dependence, cooperative behavior and intention to engage in monitoring tasks; and the implementation of pilot-monitoring tasks to observe who participated. Based on mixed-effects regressions, the results indicated that both factors can predict intended and actual participation, although cooperative behavior was a stronger and more consistent predictor. Thus, fostering community cooperation may outcompete financial benefits in ensuring engagement in natural resource management.

AB Introduction: Organizational readiness to change may be a key determinant of implementation success and a mediator of the effectiveness of implementation interventions. If organizational readiness can be reliably and validly assessed at the outset of a change initiative, it could be used to assess the effectiveness of implementation-support activities by measuring changes in readiness factors over time.
   Methods: We analyzed two waves of readiness-to-change survey data collected as part of a three-arm, randomized controlled trial to implement evidence-based health promotion practices in small worksites in low-wage industries. We measured five readiness factors: context (favorable broader conditions); change valence (valuing health promotion); information assessment (demands and resources to implement health promotion); change commitment (an intention to implement health promotion); and change efficacy (a belief in shared ability to implement health promotion). We expected commitment and efficacy to increase at intervention sites along with their self-reported effort to implement health promotion practices, termed wellness-program effort. We compared means between baseline and 15 months, and between intervention and control sites. We used linear regression to test whether intervention and control sites differed in their change-readiness scores over time.
   Results: Only context and change commitment met reliability thresholds. Change commitment declined significantly for both control (-0.39) and interventions sites (-0.29) from baseline to 15 months, while context did not change for either. Only wellness program effort at 15 months, but not at baseline, differed significantly between control and intervention sites (1.20 controls, 2.02 intervention). Regression analyses resulted in two significant differences between intervention and control sites in changes from baseline to 15 months: (1) intervention sites exhibited significantly smaller change in context scores relative to control sites over time and (2) intervention sites exhibited significantly higher changes in wellness program effort relative to control sites.
   Discussion: Contrary to our hypothesis, change commitment declined significantly at both Healthlinks and control sites, even as wellness-program effort increased significantly at HealthLinks sites. Regression to the mean may explain the decline in change commitment. Future research needs to assess whether baseline commitment is an independent predictor of wellness-program effort or an effect modifier of the HealthLinks intervention.

AB Ecosystem services are becoming increasingly important and a reason to promote the sustainable use of natural resources. Wetlands provide many valuable ecosystem services, including carbon (C) sequestration. Wetlands are an important C sink, playing a key role in climate regulation. As such, their ability to sequester C is being considered in national GHG emissions assessments and private initiatives as a potential source of revenue to manage carbon-balanced landscapes and pay for ecosystem services. To be able to implement these initiatives widely some aspects of wetland carbon science and practice still need to be formalized and standardized. Here we synthesize the scientific basis of the biogeochemical processes that drive C sequestration in wetlands and assess the methods available for its measurement. We have reviewed data in 110 peer-reviewed studies form wetlands around the world and provide an overview of the current policies and guidelines in which C sequestration in wetlands is framed as an ecosystem management practice. The intention of this review is to provide a wide and comprehensive summary of C sequestration in wetlands, from science to practice. This analysis can help inform practitioners and land-scape managers in future considerations regarding project design and policy implementation, improve current climate mitigation schemes and payment for ecosystem services frameworks, and foster the worldwide implementation of wetland restoration, creation, and conservation projects for sustainable development and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB Background
   During pregnancy, the diet of a mother-to-be should be adapted to meet increases in nutrient requirements. We analyzed the theoretical efficiency and acceptability of different types of tailored dietary changes for pregnant women.
   Methods
   The nutrient adequacy of the diet was evaluated using the PANDiet score, by comparing the nutrient intakes of 344 non-pregnant premenopausal women (18-44y) with dietary reference intakes for the first trimester of pregnancy. Simulations were performed to evaluate the theoretical efficiency of three types of ten successive tailored dietary changes in improving nutrient adequacy, with graded difficulty in implementation. The acceptability (declared intention to use in the diet) of most efficient dietary changes was evaluated during an online randomized study including 115 French pregnant women (22-41y).
   Results
   Modifying the amount consumed of foods (type-1) did not modify the food repertoire and resulted in the smallest theoretical efficiency (increase in the PANDiet score of 9.8 +/- 0.2 points), but changes were the most acceptable (probability of the intention to use: 0.30-0.78). Conversely, replacing food items by items from the same group or eaten at the same time (type-3) broadened the food repertoire (3.6 +/- 1.3 food subgroups added) and resulted in the greatest theoretical efficiency (+23.9 +/- 0.3) but changes were the least acceptable (0.07-0-23). Replacing food items within the same subgroup (type-2) slightly broadened the food repertoire (+8.0 +/- 1.3 foods) and resulted in moderate theoretical efficiency (+14.8 +/- 0.2) and intermediate acceptability (0.11-0.35).
   Conclusion
   A clear trade-off exists between the theoretical efficiency and acceptability of dietary changes, with a graded broadening of the food repertoire.

AB Background: Ethiopia is one of the countries with the highest TB burdens in the world. There are multitude of challenges related to the implementation of DOTS and adherence to treatment. This study aimed to assess patients' experiences and perceptions on associates of TB treatment adherence in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods: A phenomenological approach was employed to generate qualitative data through the in-depth interview of TB patients attending DOTS in two public health centers. A total of ten participants, who were purposively selected till conceptual saturation was reached, were interviewed using topic guides prepared in line with the study objectives. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated to English. Open Code software was used to facilitate analysis. Themes pertaining to patient, health service, therapeutic, and socioeconomic factors were developed, and findings were presented accordingly.
   Results: Experience of missing medications was reported by a single participant. Most informants pointed out that TB is transmitted through coughing and expectorate, and prevented by letting in open air in public gatherings. However, most of them stated cold air and few mentioned contaminated food as causes of TB. Perceived risk of non-adherence to medication was among recounted reasons behind treatment adherence. Some informants also recalled to have had the intention of withdrawing medication due to perceived wellness, which they actually did not change into action. Most of the participants generally had smooth relationships with their DOTS service providers. Even if more than half of the patients preferred follow-ups by the same professional, most received DOTS service by two or more service providers.
   Conclusions: TB treatment non-adherence was not found to be a major challenge among the study participants. Perceived risk and wellness were implied to be responsible factors for adherence. Albeit the fact that few informants encountered unethical behaviors by some health professionals, interviewed patients generally had positive evaluation of the patient-provider relationship and the DOTS service obtained. There is a need to train and monitor DOTS service providers and ensure the provision of DOTS service by the same provider throughout the treatment period of a given patient.

AB Background: Systematic reviews conclude that interventions to prevent overweight and obesity in children obtain stronger effects when parents are involved. Parenting practices and parent-child interactions shape children's health-related behaviours. The Healthy School Start Plus intervention aims to promote healthy dietary habits and physical activity and prevent obesity in children through parental support in disadvantaged areas with increased health needs, delivered by teachers and school nurses. This protocol describes the design, outcome and process evaluation of the study.
   Methods: Effectiveness of the intervention is compared to standard care within school health services. The 6-month programme, based on Social Cognitive Theory, consists of four components: 1) Health information to parents regarding the child; 2) Motivational Interviewing with the parents by the school nurse concerning the child; 3) classroom activities for the children by teachers; and 4) a web-based self-test of type-2 diabetes risk by parents. Effects will be studied in a cluster randomised trial including 17 schools and 352 six-year old children. The primary outcome is dietary intake of indicator foods, and secondary outcomes are physical activity, sedentary behaviour and BMI. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, at 6 months directly after the intervention, and at follow-up 18 months post baseline. Statistical analysis will be by mixed-effect regression analysis according to intention to treat and per protocol. Mediation analysis will be performed with parental self-efficacy and parenting practices. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to study implementation in terms of dose, fidelity, feasibility and acceptability. The hypothesis is that the programme will be more effective than standard care and feasible to perform in the school context.
   Discussion: The programme is in line with the cumulated evidence regarding the prevention of childhood obesity: That schools should be a focal point of prevention efforts, interventions should involve multiple components, and include the home environment. If effective, it will fill a knowledge gap concerning evidence-based health promotion practice within school health services to prevent obesity, and in the long term reduce social inequalities in health.

AB The computational neuroscience field has heavily concentrated on the modeling of neuronal functions, largely ignoring other brain cells, including one type of glial cell, the astrocytes. Despite the short history of modeling astrocytic functions, we were delighted about the hundreds of models developed so far to study the role of astrocytes, most often in calcium dynamics, synchronization, information transfer, and plasticity in vitro, but also in vascular events, hyperexcitability, and homeostasis. Our goal here is to present the state-of-the-art in computational modeling of astrocytes in order to facilitate better understanding of the functions and dynamics of astrocytes in the brain. Due to the large number of models, we concentrated on a hundred models that include biophysical descriptions for calcium signaling and dynamics in astrocytes. We categorized the models into four groups: single astrocyte models, astrocyte network models, neuron-astrocyte synapse models, and neuron-astrocyte network models to ease their use in future modeling projects. We characterized the models based on which earlier models were used for building the models and which type of biological entities were described in the astrocyte models. Features of the models were compared and contrasted so that similarities and differences were more readily apparent. We discovered that most of the models were basically generated from a small set of previously published models with small variations. However, neither citations to all the previous models with similar core structure nor explanations of what was built on top of the previous models were provided, which made it possible, in some cases, to have the same models published several times without an explicit intention to make new predictions about the roles of astrocytes in brain functions. Furthermore, only a few of the models are available online which makes it difficult to reproduce the simulation results and further develop the models. Thus, we would like to emphasize that only via reproducible research are we able to build better computational models for astrocytes, which truly advance science. Our study is the first to characterize in detail the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms that have been modeled for astrocytes.

AB Background: There is a great demand for interventions increasing work motivation in medical rehabilitation. Mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) is an established method for supporting goal pursuit, goal attainment, and goal commitment. The current study investigated whether MCII can promote work-related goals. Method: Psychosomatic rehabilitation patients participated in a work-related MCII intervention (n = 100). Control group members (n = 100) participated in a work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR) without MCII intervention. Postintervention evaluation was conducted using questionnaires for psychosomatic symptoms, treatment satisfaction, and therapeutic goals. Results: Patients in the intervention group had twice as many work-related goals compared with patients in the control group (OR = 2.292, 95% CI = 1.049-5.004). After the intervention, patients found goal attainment more likely and had a plan for it. They were more satisfied with the results of their rehabilitation. Conclusion: MCII helped patients prioritize work-related goals. MCII. which focuses on the motivation to return to work, is a time- and cost-effective method in medical rehabilitation.

AB Deriving the benefits of electronic information resources as provided by electronic medical record systems (EMR) on a global scale is critically dependent on physicians' adoption and continued use of such resources. Yet, there is little known about the factors that motivate physicians to adopt and continue to use electronic information resources. The purpose of this article is to investigate the motivational factors leading to adoption and usage of electronic information resources in diverse regions of the world including developing countries (India and Egypt) and developed countries (the US). Based on the socio-cognitive theory and the decomposed theory of planned behavior, the authors surveyed 314 physicians in three countries in order to assess their engagement with electronic information resources. Data was analyzed via PLS for direct and indirect effects of socio-cognitive constructs and their impact on electronic information resources' use intentions. The authors' results suggest there are similarities as well as differences in factors impacting adoption and usage of electronic information resources pre and post EMR implementation in both developing and developed countries. They found that physicians' perceptions of effort expectations, technological infrastructure and support, and computer self-efficacy were the strongest direct drivers influencing intentions to use electronic information resources both in pre and post-EMR implementations in all three countries that were studied. However, a richer set of factors contributed to physicians' intentions to continue to use electronic information resources, post-EMR, in developed countries as compared to pre-EMR in developing countries. Social influences had a strong indirect effects, influencing physicians' perceptions of effort expectations post-EMR as well as perceptions of performance expectations pre-EMR implementation. Computer self-efficacy was a significant predictor of effort expectations of an electronic information resource both pre and post-EMR implementation while compatibility with physicians' practices significantly influenced performance expectations in both pre and post EMR implementations in all three countries studied. The authors' study provides important theoretical and practical implications for successful management and implementation of electronic information resources such that they are adopted and used in the healthcare environment.

AB Telephone crisis-line workers (TCWs) are trained in a variety of techniques and skills to facilitate the identification of suicidal callers. One factor that may influence the implementation of these skills is gender. This study used an experimental design to explore whether helpline callers being identified as male or female is associated with TCWs' ratings of callers' potential for suicide risk and TCWs' intention to use support- or intervention-oriented skills with callers. Data were collected using an online self-report survey in an Australian sample of 133 TCWs. The results suggest that under some circumstances the callers' gender might influence TCWs' intention to use intervention-oriented skills with the caller. Implications for the training of telephone crisis workers, and those trained in suicide prevention more broadly are discussed.

AB Background: A recent randomized controlled trial found that an intervention focused on developing an exercise habit increased weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) over 8 wk compared to a control group. The purpose of the current study was to test if changes in habit, as well as other behavioral strategy constructs from the Multi-Process Action Control Test, mediated between group condition and MVPA (self-report and accelerometry).
   Methods: Inactive new gym members (N=94) were randomized into control or experimental (habit-building) groups.
   Results: No construct entirely explained mediation condition (experimental and control) and changes in MVPA measured by accelerometry. Self-report MVPA found affective judgments, behavioral regulation, and preparatory habit to be mediated between group (experimental/control conditions) and changes in behavior (beta = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [.05-.78]).
   Conclusions: Self-reported and objectively measured behavior models demonstrated complete and partial mediation, respectively. New gym members could benefit from successful behavioral enactment by developing constructs to support habit formation.

AB We design an experiment to investigate whether asking people to state how much they will donate to a charity (i.e., to pledge) increases their actual donation. Individuals' endowment is either certain or a random variable. We study different types of pledges, namely, private, public and irrevocable, which differ in terms of the cost to the individual for not keeping the promise. We show that in absence of endowment uncertainty, private and public pledges are associated with lower donations as compared to donations in the no pledge case: private pledges slightly reduce donations and public pledges reduce them more significantly. Donations increase with uncertainty (in terms of increased endowment dispersion) for both private and public pledge situations, although donations with private pledges remain higher than donations with public pledge.

SO ELT JOURNAL

AB This article explores how teachers understand and implement motivational strategies in an ELT context. A qualitative study was carried out with 26 experienced in-service primary school teachers. The study identified initial understandings of the concept of motivation and specific ways in which teachers aimed to implement motivational strategies in their classrooms. The findings verified the hypothesis that teachers' understandings of motivation were limited and did not reflect the theoretical advances made over recent decades in ELT-related motivational research. The study traced the changes in understandings resulting from a 30-hour, in-service staff training programme developing a process-oriented approach to motivation. The results show that significant changes in understandings can be achieved through focused training activities, with participants expressing clear intentions to apply their new understandings in their classrooms in a way which will shift the emphasis from current teacher-centred approaches to more learner-sensitive environments.

ID SURGERY; IMPLEMENTATION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; COHORT; IMPACT
AB Background. The World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSCL) as part of the Safe Surgery Saves Lives campaign. This is aimed at improving surgical safety worldwide. Despite many perceived benefits of the SSCL, compliance and acceptance in many areas remain poor.
   Objectives. To investigate perceptions of theatre staff regarding the checklist and to identify reasons and barriers for poor compliance and implementation.
   Methods. Questionnaires were handed out to theatre teams across all surgical disciplines at two large hospitals in Durban, South Africa, over a 2-week period. Data collected included role in theatre, intention of the SSCL, training received, as well as questions regarding previously identified barriers and staff perceptions.
   Results. Questionnaires were distributed to 225 practitioners, with a response rate of 81.7% from 51 nurses, 54 anaesthetists and 79 surgeons. Rank of medical staff included 52 seniors (consultants) and 81 juniors (registrars and medical officers). The majority (95%) of respondents perceived the SSCL as intended to improve safety, prevent errors or reduce morbidity and mortality. A total of 146 respondents (79.3%) received no SSCL training. No new barriers were identified, but previously identified barriers were confirmed. Our key factors were time-related issues and lack of buy-in from team members. Surgeons were perceived as being supportive by 45.1% of respondents, in contrast to nurses (62.5%), anaesthetists (70.1%) and management (68.5%). When compared with junior staff, senior staff were 5-fold more likely to feel that staff did not need to be trained and 8-fold more likely to indicate that the checklist did not improve patient safety.
   Conclusions. The WHO SSCL is an important tool in the operating room environment. The barriers in our setting are similar to those identified in other settings. There needs to be widespread training in the use of the SSCL, including adaptation of the checklist to make it fit for purpose in our setting. Improving use of the checklist will allow theatre staff to work together towards ensuring a safer theatre environment for both patients and staff.

AB While much of the extant InfoSec research relies on single assessment models that predict intent to act, this article proposes a multi-stage InfoSec Process Action Model (IPAM) that can positively change individual InfoSec behavior. We believe that this model will allow InfoSec researchers to focus more directly on the process that leads to action and develop better interventions that address problematic security behaviors. Building on successful healthcare efforts that resulted in smoking cessation, regular exercise, and a healthier diet, among others, IPAM is a hybrid predictive process approach to behavioral InfoSec improvement. IPAM formulates the motivational antecedents of intent as separate from the volitional drivers of behavior. Singular fear appeals often seen in InfoSec research are replaced by more nuanced treatments appropriately differentiated to support behavioral change as part of a process; phase-appropriate measures of self-efficacy are employed to more precisely assess the likelihood that a participant will act on good intentions; and decisional balance -assessment of pro and con perceptions - is monitored over time. These notions better align InfoSec research with both leading security practice and successful comparators in healthcare. We believe IPAM can both help InfoSec research models better explain actual behavior and better inform practical security behavior improvement initiatives.

ID PLANNED BEHAVIOR; IMPLEMENTATION
AB OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to describe the associations of nurses' hand hygiene (HH) attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control with observed and self-reported HH behavior.
   BACKGROUND Hand hygiene is an essential strategy to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Despite tremendous efforts, nurses' HH adherence rates remain suboptimal.
   METHODS This quantitative descriptive study of ICU nurses in the southeastern United States was guided by the theory of planned behavior. The self-administered Patient Safety Opinion Survey and iScrub application, which facilitates observation, comprised the data set.
   RESULTS Nurses' observed HH median was 55%; tendency to self-report was a much higher 90%. Subjective norm and perceived control scores were associated with observed and self-reported HH (P < .05) but not attitude scores or reports of intention.
   CONCLUSIONS Nurses' subjective norm and perceived control are associated with observed and self-reported HH performance. Healthcare workers overestimate their HH performance. Findings suggest future research to explore manipulators of these variables to change nurses' HH behavior.

AB Background:Despite a recognized need for improved communications and logistics in high acuity situations, the integration of telemedicine services into the mainstream health services has been difficult. This study reports on the opinions of Romanian professional responders to mass casualty incidents and disasters regarding the use and requirements of specific electronic medical documentation solutions.Materials and Methods:Doctors, nurses, paramedics, and fire department officers participated in a customized online structured questionnaire. To assess factors associated with the current use of information technology and the willingness to adopt an exclusive optimized electronic system, a multivariate analysis was performed. Logistic regression was used for free input key elements regarding the most useful technical and operative improvements and medical documentation solutions for large-scale events.Results:A total of 536 respondents provided answers between the second half of the year 2014 and the first half of the year 2015. Doctors and nurses were the most frequent users of documentation techniques, especially if they were employed at a high-level emergency care center. Professionals' duties were perceived as increasingly impaired by the use of current electronic systems as those duties became more complex. All respondents favored an optimized large-scale event electronic solution, emphasizing the need for enhanced communications, technical equipment, cooperation, and workflow mainly by integrating mobile devices, dedicated software, remote databases, and interlink capabilities.Conclusions:Professionals support the implementation of an integrated electronic system for large-scale events if outlined requirements are met to maximize user acceptance.

AB Objective: To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of providing assisted reproductive services as part of routine HIV care and treatment in Ethiopia.
   Methods: The present cross-sectional study using semistructured in-depth interviews was conducted at St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, during July 2014 and July 2015. The interviews assessed the perspectives of healthcare providers (HCPs) regarding the reproductive desires of HIV-affected couples, on assisting them in achieving pregnancy, and on the facilitators and barriers to offering such services as part of routine HIV care.
   Results: There were 40 HCPs from two SPHMMC clinics interviewed. All HCPs asserted that HIV-affected couples should have equal access to assisted reproductive services and most agreed that couples should have this access to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, even in the absence of underlying infertility. However, the HCPs cited systemic and structural barriers to the implementation and delivery of assisted reproductive services.
   Conclusion: The integration of assisted reproductive services into HIV care and treatment programs is acceptable and feasible to HCPs. Formal training of HCPs may improve the implementation of these services for HIV-affected couples in low-resource settings.

SO JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS

DT Article
AB Governments, oil companies and universities frequently pay lip service to such noble concepts as empowerment, local content, workforce nationalization and knowledge transfer. Unfortunately, well-intentioned and loudly-touted programmes typically begin with great fanfare and admirable intentions but seldom meet expectations in the long term. One happy exception has been the Masters of Oil and Gas Law and Management at Angola's Agostinho Neto University ('Program') which recently celebrated 10 years of existence. The authors describe the genesis, history and methodology of this unique Program in whose development and implementation they played crucial roles. They also recount their promotional visits to law schools and other institutions on four other continents and the tangible effects that the Program has had outside of Angola. The article identifies a number of lessons learned in the process and hopefully will serve as a roadmap for those wishing to recreate the Program's success elsewhere. In short, this is the story of how a major oil company and a national law school brought together a world class teaching faculty and local experts for the benefit of more than 230 professionals and the nation as a whole.

ID COMPETENCE; DEPRESSION; PSYCHOLOGY
AB Objective The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate a new residency training rotation focused on cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) and to assess outcomes across multiple domains.
   Methods Data are presented from 30 psychiatry residents. Primary learning-related outcomes included content knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes and behavioral intentions towards evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT).
   Results Residents reported significant increases in CBT knowledge, CBT-specific self-efficacy, overall psychotherapy self-efficacy, belief in patient benefit from CBT, and behavioral intention to use CBT. However, there were almost no changes in attitudes towards evidence-based practice more broadly, with one significant finding showing an increase in skepticism towards such practices.
   Conclusions This empirically based example of training program development, implementation, and evaluation appears largely successful and represents one approach for addressing the CBT competency goals outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and Milestone Project Guidelines. Despite these initial, positive findings, conclusions should be tempered by limitations of the project design (e.g., the lack of comparison group, absence of objective measures of resident behavioral change, or assessment of the effect of such changes on patient outcomes). Findings highlight the need for continued development and evaluation of training methods in CBT for residency programs.

AB With the recent advances in information technologies, Learning Management Systems have taken on a significant role in providing educational resources. The successful use of these systems in higher education is important for the implementation, management and continuous improvement of e-learning services to increase the quality of learning. This study aimed to identify the factors affecting higher education students' behavioral intention towards Learning Management Systems. A research model was proposed based on the belief factors of the technology acceptance model; namely perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use and external factors including self-efficacy, enjoyment, subjective norm, satisfaction, and interactivity and control. Then, a self-reported questionnaire was distributed online. A total of 470 higher education students participated in the survey. The proposed structural model was assessed and validated using structural equation modeling, in particular the partial least square method. The predictors of behavioral intention were identified as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, enjoyment, subjective norm, satisfaction, and interactivity and control with the validated structural model. The relationships between the influencing factors provided an insight about the students' behavioral intention towards the use of Learning Management Systems. It is expected that the academicians and practitioners will benefit from the design and findings of the current study in their future research.

AB Purpose. Adolescent females continue to face health consequences associated with risky sexual behaviors such as unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a gender-specific intervention targeted to early adolescent females. Method. This study used an intent to treat randomized clinical trial comparing a broad-based female empowerment curriculum with a dose-matched science and technology female leadership curriculum. The sample (N = 801) was recruited from schools and was implemented in community-based settings mostly in an after school context. Assessments were conducted at baseline, postintervention, 6-, and 18-month follow-up time periods. Results. Both groups in the study obtained good implementation and engagement. The average attendance rate was 81% of program sessions. There were significant differences between the two groups favoring the intervention group on measures of sexually transmitted disease knowledge and condom technical skills. On a measure of condom self-efficacy, there was a significant trend. At the postassessment, there was a significant difference on the intentions to reduce sexual risk behaviors. Both the intervention and control groups made gains on the self-assertive behavior scale. Conclusions. Gender-specific programs for early adolescent females can help reduce indicators that are related to sexual risk reduction. More long-term follow-up is needed to assess impact on sexual behaviors. Efforts directed at a younger population of females should continue to be researched for potential in reducing sexual risks.

AB Aims: This discussion paper proposes a five-part theoretical framework to inform recruitment strategies. The framework is based on a marketing model of consumer decision-making.
   Background: Respondents in surveys are typically healthier than non-respondents, which has an impact on the availability of information about those most in need. Previous research has identified response patterns, provided theories about why people participate in research and evaluated different recruitment strategies. Social marketing has been applied successfully to recruitment and promotes focus on the needs of the participant, but little attention has been paid to the periods before and after participant-researcher contact (during advertising and following completion of studies). We propose a new model which conceptualises participation as a decision involving motivation, perception of information, attitude formation, integration of intention and action and finally evaluation and sharing of experience.
   Design: Discussion paper.
   Data sources: This discussion paper presents a critical review. No literature was excluded on date and the included citations span the years 1981-2017.
   Implications for nursing: The proposed framework suggests that researchers could engage a broader demographic if they shape research design and advertising to perform functions that participants are seeking to achieve. The framework provides a novel and useful conceptualisation of recruitment which could help to inform public engagement in research design, researcher training and research policy.
   Conclusion: This framework challenges researchers to investigate the goals of the potential participants when designing a study's advertising and procedures.

AB Cities all over the world have activated policy support for urban consolidation in recent decades. Rationales for urban consolidation focus on its perceived ability to achieve sustainability goals, including decreased automobile dependence, increased social cohesion and greater walkability. Despite this, there are few international examples of urban consolidation policy implementation that has achieved its stated aims. This paper explores the nature and character of perceptions of urban consolidation held by urban planners, developers, architects and local politicians. The perspectives held by these city shapers' are integral to urban consolidation debates and delivery, yet the nature and character of their specific views are underexplored in urban studies literature. This paper combines the theoretical lens of Social Representations Theory with the methodological approach of Q-methodology to understand the common sense understandings of urban consolidation held by city shapers in Brisbane, Australia. It identifies, synthesises and critically discusses the social representations employed by city shapers to understand, promote and communicate about urban consolidation. Findings indicate that urban consolidation debates and justifications diverge significantly from stated policy intentions and are based on differing views on good' urban form, the role of planning and community consultation and the value of higher density housing. We conclude that there is utility and value in identifying how urban consolidation strategies are influenced by the shared beliefs, myths and perceptions held by city shapers. Understanding these narratives and their influence is fundamental to understanding the power-laden manipulation of policy definitions and development outcomes.

AB The implementation of educational reforms requires behavioral changes from the teachers involved. Theories on successful behavioral change prescribe the following conditions: teachers need to possess the necessary knowledge and skills, form strong positive intentions to perform the new behavior, and have a supporting environment for change. However, existing approaches to teacher professional development in the context of educational reforms are predominantly aimed at the development of knowledge and skills and at creating a supporting environment, but lack attention to teachers' intentions to change. In the study described in this article, we performed "motivating-for-educational-change" interviews (MECI) and explored the influence on teachers' intentions to change in the direction of the proposed national biology education reform, that is, the introduction of a context-based curriculum. The MECI comprised two tools: building on earlier successful experiences and using lesson segments to rearrange instructional approaches. We explored the influence of the MECI technique on the strength and specificity of participating teachers' intentions. When conducting the MECI, many participants expressed that they now realized how they had already implemented aspects of the reform in their regular instructional approaches. Furthermore, all the participants formulated stronger and more specific intentions to change their regular instructional approach towards that of the proposed reform while taking their regular instructional approach as a starting point.

AB Objective Regardless of the acceptance of users, information and communication systems can be considered as a health intervention designed to improve the care delivered to patients. This study aimed to determine the adoption and use of the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM2) by the users of hospital information system (HIS) in paraclinical departments including laboratory, radiology, and nutrition and to investigate the key factors of adoption and use of these systems.
   Materials and Methods A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from nearly 253 users of these systems in paraclinical departments of eight university hospitals in two different cities of Iran. A total of 202 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study (105 in Urmia and 97 in Khorramabad). The data were processed using LISREL and SPSS software and statistical analysis technique was based on the structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Results It was found that the original TAM constructs had a significant impact on the staffs' behavioral intention to adopt HIS in paraclinical departments. The results of this study indicated that cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use), except for result demonstrability, were significant predictors of intention to use, whereas the result revealed no significant relationship between social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and the users' behavioral intention to use the system.
   Conclusion The results confirmed that several factors in the TAM2 that were important in previous studies were not significant in paraclinical departments and in government-owned hospitals. The users' behavior factors are essential for successful usage of the system and should be considered. It provides valuable information for hospital system providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges as well as practical guidance for the successful implementation of information systems in paraclinical departments.

AB This study adopted the diffusion paradigm to study the implementation and development of land information systems (LIS). Using a theoretical structural model based on the combination of three acceptance theories, this study identifies the underlying factors affecting the adoption of an LIS in Liberia. Participants included 102 public servants from different sectors. The methodology of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the impacts on the intention to adopt an LIS. The results indicated that the intention of individuals to use LIS was influenced by personal innovativeness, attitude and perceived behavior control toward LIS. The path analysis of pre-determinants to these crucial factors demonstrated that LIS system design that leads to an increased perception of usefulness and ease of use would contribute to positive attitudes. Based on the survey analysis, several behavior interventions and land information policy suggestions were proposed for the specific sector. Finally, limitations and future directions were discussed.

AB We systematically reviewed research on cognitive training and neuromodulation interventions for reducing food craving/intake, unhealthy diet and weight, and discussed their mechanisms of action. We reviewed 50 studies involving six cognitive trainings: Approach and Attentional Bias Modification, Implementation Intentions, Response Inhibition, Episodic Future Thinking and Working Memory; and four neuromodulation approaches: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and Neurofeedback. Response Inhibition and Implementation Intentions have shown to reduce unhealthy diet and weight in people with overweight/obesity. Attentional Bias Modification has shown promising results in healthy-weight participants. Brain stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex via tDCS and the Hypothalamus via DBS showed benefits for reducing food craving and weight in people with overweight/obesity. Studies quality was generally high, but most trials were short-term and many conducted in healthy-weight samples. Modification of cognitive control and motivational processes/circuits are common mechanisms of beneficial training and neuromodulation interventions, and thus a promising approach for overweight/obesity treatment. Longer duration trials in clinical populations are needed to confirm benefits.

AB BackgroundIncorporating evidence-based practice (EBP) into clinical decision making and professional practice is a requirement for many health disciplines, yet research across health disciplines on factors that influence and predict student intention to use EBP following graduation has not been previously synthesized.
   AimTo synthesize research on factors that influence development of EBP behaviors and subsequently predict undergraduate students' intention toward EBP uptake.
   MethodsA systematic review of prediction modeling studies was conducted according to a protocol previously published on the Prospero database: . The outcome variable was undergraduate students' future use or intention to use EBP. Evidence synthesis methods were guided by resources from the Cochrane Methods Prognosis Group Web site ().
   Results and FindingsOnly three studies were found to meet inclusion criteria for the review. Factors relating to EBP capability, EBP attitudes, as well as clinical and academic support were identified as influential toward students' intention to use evidence in practice. Heterogeneity limited data pooling, consequently, results are presented in narrative and tabular form.
   Linking Evidence to ActionAlthough using a developing method, this review presents a unique contribution to further discussions regarding students' intention to use EBP following graduation. Despite limitations, consideration of identified factors for undergraduate curriculum could support student's intention to use EBP in their respective clinical environments.

AB This paper analyses the role of external pressures, internal motivations and their interplay, with the intention of identifying whether they drive substantive or instead symbolic implementation of ISO 14001. The context is one of economic crisis. We focus on Greece, where the economic crisis has weakened the country's institutional environment, and analyse qualitatively new interview data from 45 ISO 14001 certified firms. Our findings show that (a) weak external pressures can lead to a symbolic implementation of ISO 14001, as firms can defend their legitimacy without incurring the costs of internalization in the local market; (b) weak external pressures can lead to substantive implementation of ISO 14001 when firms have strong internal motivations seeking to strategically differentiate from competitors in international markets. Firms internalize ISO 14001 so as to restore their legitimacy and reputation in foreign markets and stimulate their competitiveness; and (c) strong internal motivations pave the way for companies to stimulate their competitiveness by enhancing their efficiency, as some companies might strengthen their position in the local market by implementing ISO 14001 substantively. The contribution of this paper to the literature on ISO 14001 internalization lies in refining existing theory on the importance of internal motivations for the substantive implementation of ISO 14001 in the context of economic crisis. In addition, this paper extends current theory by challenging studies that dismiss the importance of external pressures. We argue that the intensity of external pressures influences the internalization of ISO 14001, but propose that this relationship might not be linear.

ID HEALTH-CARE; VOLUME; QUALITY; HOSPITALS; OUTCOMES
AB The bundling of clinical expertise in centralised treatment centres is considered an effective intervention to improve quality and efficiency of acute stroke care. In 2010, 8 London Trusts were converted into Hyper Acute Stroke Units. The intention was to discontinue acute stroke services in 22 London hospitals. However, in reality, provision of services declined only gradually, and 2years later, 15% of all patients were still treated in Trusts without a Hyper Acute Stroke Unit. This study evaluates the impact of centralising London's stroke care on 7 process and outcome indicators using a difference-in-difference analysis with two treatment groups, Hyper Acute and discontinued London Trusts, and data on all stroke patients recorded in the hospital episode statistics database from April 2006 to April 2014. The policy resulted in improved thrombolysis treatment and lower rates of pneumonia in acute units. However, 6 indicators worsened in the Trusts that were meant to discontinue services, including deaths within 7 and 30days, readmissions, brain scan rates, and thrombolysis treatment. The reasons for these results are difficult to uncover and could be related to differences in patient complexity, data recording, or quality of care. The findings highlight that actual implementation of centralisation policies needs careful monitoring and evaluation.

AB Conservation decisions increasingly involve multiple environmental and social objectives, which result in complex decision contexts with high potential for trade-offs. Improving social equity is one such objective that is often considered an enabler of successful outcomes and a virtuous ideal in itself. Despite its idealized importance in conservation policy, social equity is often highly simplified or ill-defined and is applied uncritically. What constitutes equitable outcomes and processes is highly normative and subject to ethical deliberation. Different ethical frameworks may lead to different conceptions of equity through alternative perspectives of what is good or right. This can lead to different and potentially conflicting equity objectives in practice. We promote a more transparent, nuanced, and pluralistic conceptualization of equity in conservation decision making that particularly recognizes where multidimensional equity objectives may conflict. To help identify and mitigate ethical conflicts and avoid cases of good intentions producing bad outcomes, we encourage a more analytical incorporation of equity into conservation decision making particularly during mechanistic integration of equity objectives. We recommend that in conservation planning motivations and objectives for equity be made explicit within the problem context, methods used to incorporate equity objectives be applied with respect to stated objectives, and, should objectives dictate, evaluation of equity outcomes and adaptation of strategies be employed during policy implementation.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to describe healthcare professionals' views of smart glasses before their implementation in an intensive care unit, both regarding quality of use of the glasses and to identify possible intensive care situations where the glasses could be used to increase patient safety.
   Methods: Data were generated through focus group interviews and analysed using thematic content analysis.
   Findings: The findings describe participants' views of smart glasses divided into three categories; Smart glasses to facilitate work at intensive care unit; Quality of use and Utilisation. Participants assumed smart glasses to cause both effect and affect in intensive care. Participants' concern for patients arose recurrently and through their concern intention to work to promote patient safety.
   Conclusion: Smart glasses are suggested as a complement to existing monitoring and routines and cannot replace human presence in intensive care. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction Unintended pregnancy has been a concerning public health problem for decades. As we begin to understand the complexities of pregnancy intention and how women experience these pregnancies, reproductive life planning offers a paradigm shift. Methods Reproductive life planning is a patient-centered approach that places a patient's reproductive preferences-whether concrete or ambivalent-at the forefront of her clinical care. Results This process grants women and men the opportunity to consider how reproduction fits within the context of their broader lives. Within a clinical encounter, reproductive life planning allows counseling and care to be tailored to patient preferences. Discussion Although there is great potential for positive public health impacts in unintended pregnancy, contraceptive use and improved preconception health, the true benefit lies within reinforcing reproductive empowerment. Despite recommendations for universal adoption, many questions remain regarding implementation, equity and outcomes.

AB Although parents often report positive intentions to promote and create a healthy food environment for their children (e.g., setting limits to snacks offered), they also experience difficulties in translating these intentions into actual behaviors. In this position paper, we argue that automatic processes explain an important part of the gap between parents' intentions and their actual food parenting behaviors. We provide a conceptual framework in which we hypothesize that automatic effects on food parenting occur through two key interrelated constructs: habits (key outcome construct) and volitional regulation behaviors (key mediating construct). Moreover, we discuss potentially important impulse-focused techniques that may directly change habits (e.g., nudging; inhibitory control training) or indirectly through volitional regulation behaviors (e.g., implementation intentions; mental contrasting). We make use of the literature on the role of intention-behavior discordance in general health behaviors and discuss implications for food parenting practices. Our framework provides a dual process view towards food parenting and may help to explain when and why parents are likely to engage in (un)healthy food parenting behaviors. In addition, this framework may hopefully stimulate research on (combinations of old and) new techniques to promote good food parenting behaviors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), significant therapeutic gaps remain for this devastating disease. Yet, few innovative therapies beyond the traditional pathways of endothelial dysfunction have reached clinical trial phases in PAH. Although there are inherent limitations of the currently available models of PAH, the leaky pipeline of innovative therapies relates, in part, to flawed preclinical research methodology, including lack of rigour in trial design, incomplete invasive hemodynamic assessment, and lack of careful translational studies that replicate randomized controlled trials in humans with attention to adverse effects and benefits. Rigorous methodology should include the use of prespecified eligibility criteria, sample sizes that permit valid statistical analysis, randomization, blinded assessment of standardized outcomes, and transparent reporting of results. Better design and implementation of preclinical studies can minimize inherent flaws in the models of PAH, reduce the risk of bias, and enhance external validity and our ability to distinguish truly promising therapies form many false-positive or overstated leads. Ideally, preclinical studies should use advanced imaging, study several preclinical pulmonary hypertension models, or correlate rodent and human findings and consider the fate of the right ventricle, which is the major determinant of prognosis in human PAH. Although these principles are widely endorsed, empirical evidence suggests that such rigor is often lacking in pulmonary hypertension preclinical research. The present article discusses the pitfalls in the design of preclinical pulmonary hypertension trials and discusses opportunities to create preclinical trials with improved predictive value in guiding early-phase drug development in patients with PAH, which will need support not only from researchers, peer reviewers, and editors but also from academic institutions, funding agencies, and animal ethics authorities.

AB Background: Like other sectors, the healthcare sector has to deal with the issue of users' acceptance of IT. In healthcare, different factors affecting healthcare professionals' acceptance of software applications have been investigated. Unfortunately, inconsistent results have been found, maybe because the different studies focused on different IT and occupational groups. Consequently, more studies are needed to investigate these implications for recent technology, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR).
   Methods: Given these findings in the existing literature, we pose the following research question: "To what extent do the different categories of clinical staff (physicians, paraprofessionals and administrative personnel) influence the intention to use an EHR and its antecedents?" To answer this research question we develop a research model that we empirically tested via a survey, including the following variables: intention to use, ease of use, usefulness, anxiety, self-efficacy, trust, misfit and data security. Our purpose is to clarify the possible differences existing between different staff categories.
   Results: For the entire personnel, all the hypotheses are confirmed: anxiety, self-efficacy, trust influence ease of use; ease of use, misfit, self-efficacy, data security impact usefulness; usefulness and ease of use contribute to intention to use the EHR. They are also all confirmed for physicians, residents, carers and nurses but not for secretaries and assistants. Secretaries' and assistants' perception of the ease of use of EHR does not influence their intention to use it and they could not be influenced by self-efficacy in the development of their perception of the ease of use of EHR.
   Conclusions: These results may be explained by the fact that secretaries, unlike physicians and nurses, have to follow rules and procedures for their work, including working with EHR. They have less professional autonomy than healthcare professionals and no medical responsibility. This result is also in line with previous literature highlighting that administrators are more motivated by the use of IT in healthcare.

AB The rule/plan motor cognition (RPMC) paradigm elicits visually indistinguishable motor outputs, resulting from either plan- or rule-based action-selection, using a combination of essentially interchangeable stimuli. Previous implementations of the RPMC paradigm have used pantomimed movements to compare plan- vs. rule-based action-selection. In the present work we attempt to determine the generalizability of previous RPMC findings to real object interaction by use of a grasp-to-rotate task. In the plan task, participants had to use prospective planning to achieve a comfortable post-handle rotation hand posture. The rule task used implementation intentions (if-then rules) leading to the same comfortable end-state. In Experiment A, we compare RPMC performance of 16 healthy participants in pantomime and real object conditions of the experiment, within-subjects. Higher processing efficiency of rule-vs. plan-based action-selection was supported by diffusion model analysis. Results show a significant response-time increase in the pantomime condition compared to the real object condition and a greater response-time advantage of rule-based vs. plan-based actions in the pantomime compared to the real object condition. In Experiment B, 24 healthy participants performed the real object RPMC task in a task switching vs. a blocked condition. Results indicate that plan-based action-selection leads to longer response-times and less efficient information processing than rule-based action-selection in line with previous RPMC findings derived from the pantomime action-mode. Particularly in the task switching mode, responses were faster in the rule compared to the plan task suggesting a modulating influence of cognitive load. Overall, results suggest an advantage of rule-based action-selection over plan-based action-selection; whereby differential mechanisms appear to be involved depending on the action-mode. We propose that cognitive load is a factor that modulates the advantageous effect of implementation intentions in motor cognition on different levels as illustrated by the varying speed advantages and the variation in diffusion parameters per action-mode or condition, respectively.

AB This study aims to explore organizations' intrinsic drivers of voluntarily adopting environmental innovations that are in early stage of diffusion. In particular, it investigates the vital role of dynamic capabilities in the decision-making process of adoption. Adopting a process-oriented model, this study focuses on the initiation (instead of implementation) process of innovation adoption and examines how dynamic capabilities can result in intention of adopting environmental innovation voluntarily. The findings show that dynamic capabilities have positive effects on organizational intention of adoption not only directly, but also indirectly through facilitating managers to interpret environmental innovations as an opportunity, rather than a threat. Furthermore, this partial mediating role of managerial interpretation between dynamic capabilities and environmental innovation adoption varies depending on organizational social position. Compared to central firms, peripheral firms tend to be more responsive to managerial interpretation. The chain from dynamic capabilities, to interpretation of environmental innovation as an opportunity, and finally to the intention of adoption is stronger for peripheral firms than for central ones.

TI Impact of universal medical insurance system on the accessibility of

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   China's universal medical insurance system (UMIS) is designed to promote social fairness through improving access to medical services and reducing out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for all Chinese. However, it is still not known whether UMIS has a significant impact on the accessibility of medical service supply and the affordability, as well as the seeking-care choice, of patients in China.
   Methods
   Segmented time-series regression analysis, as a powerful statistical method of interrupted time series design, was used to estimate the changes in the quantity and quality of medical service supply before and after the implementation of UMIS. The rates of catastrophic payments and seeking-care choices for UMIS beneficiaries were selected to measure the affordability and medical service flow of patients after the implementation of UMIS.
   Results
   China's UMIS was established in 2008. After that, the trending increase of the expenditure of the UMIS was higher than that of increase in revenue compared to previous years. Up to 2014, the UMIS had covered 97.5% of the entire population in China. After introduction of the UMIS, there were significant increases in licensed physicians, nurses, and hospital beds per 1000 individuals. In addition, hospital outpatient visits and inpatient visits per year increased compared to the pre-UMIS period. The average fatality rate of inpatients in the overall hospital and general hospital and the average fatality rate due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in general hospitals was significantly decreased. In contrast, no significant and prospective changes were observed in rural physicians per 1000 individuals, inpatient visits and inpatient fatality rate in the community centers and township hospitals compared to the pre-UMIS period. After 2008, the rates of catastrophic payments for UMIS inpatients at different income levels were declining at three levels of hospitals. Whichever income level, the rate of catastrophic payments for inpatients of Urban Employee's Basic Medical Insurance was the lowest. For the low-income patients, a single hospitalization at a tertiary hospital can lead to catastrophic payments. It is needless to say what the economic burden could be if patients required multiple hospitalizations within a year. UMIS beneficiaries showed the intention of growth to seek hospitalization services in tertiary hospitals.
   Conclusions
   Introduction of the UMIS contributed to an increase in available medical services and the use thereof, and a decrease in fatality rate. The affordability of UMIS beneficiaries for medical expenses was successfully ameliorated. The differences in patients' affordability are mainly manifested in different medical insurance schemes and different seeking-care choices. The ability of the poor patients covered by UMIS to resist catastrophic medical payments is still relatively weak. Therefore, the current UMIS should reform the insurance payment model to promote the integration of medical services and the formation of a tiered treatment system. UMIS also should establish supplementary medical insurance packages for the poor.

AB Objective This paper describes the design and methods of a cluster randomised controlled trial (C-RCT) to determine the effectiveness of a community mobilisation intervention that is designed to reduce the perpetration of violence against women (YAW).
   Methods and analysis A C-RCT of nine intervention and nine control clusters is being carried out in a periurban, semiformal settlement near Johannesburg, South Africa, between 2016 and 2018. A community mobilisation and advocacy intervention, called Sonke CHANGE is being implemented over 18 months. It comprises local advocacy and group activities to engage community members to challenge harmful gender norms and reduce VAW. The intervention is hypothesised to improve equitable masculinities, reduce alcohol use and ultimately, to reduce VAW. Intervention effectiveness will he determined through an audio computer-assisted self-interview questionnaire with behavioural measures among 2600 men aged between 18 and 40 years at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. The primary trial outcome is men's use of physical and/or sexual VAIN. Secondary outcomes include harmful alcohol use, gender attitudes, controlling behaviours, transactional sex and social cohesion. The main analysis will he intention-to treat based on the randomisation of clusters. A qualitative process evaluation is being conducted alongside the C-RCT. Implementers and men participating in the intervention will be interviewed longitudinally over the period of intervention implementation and observations of the workshops and other intervention activities are being carried out.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee and procedures comply with ethical recommendations of the United Nations Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence. Dissemination of research findings will take place with local stakeholders and through peer-reviewed publications, with data available on request or after 5 years of trial completion.

TI Caution Ahead: Research Challenges of a Randomized Controlled Trial
   Implemented to Improve Breast Cancer Treatment at Safety-Net Hospitals
SO JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID RACIAL DISPARITIES; CARE; OPPORTUNITIES; INTERVENTIONS
AB Purpose
   To implement and test a Web-based tracking and feedback (T&F) tool to close referral loops and reduce adjuvant breast cancer treatment underuse in safety-net hospitals (SNHs).
   Patient and Methods
   We randomly assigned 10 SNHs, identified patients with new stage 1 to stage 3 breast cancer, assessed their connection with the oncologist, and relayed this information to surgeons for follow-up. We interviewed key informants about the tool's usefulness. We conducted intention-to-treat and pre- and poststudy analyses to assess the T&F tool and implementation effectiveness, respectively.
   Results
   Between the study start and intervention implementation, several hospitals reorganized care delivery and 49% of patients scheduled to undergo breast cancer surgery were ineligible because they already were in contact with an oncologist. One high-volume hospital closed. Despite randomization of hospitals, intervention (INT) hospitals had fewer white patients (5% v 16%; P = .0005), and more underuse (28% v 15%; P = .002) compared with usual care (UC) hospitals. Over time, INT hospitals with poorer follow-up significantly reduced underuse compared with UC hospitals (INT hospitals, from 33% to 9%, P = .001 v UC hospitals, from 15% to 11%, P = .5). There was no difference in underuse (9% at INT hospitals, 11% at UC hospitals; P = .8). Hospitals with better follow-up (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.98) had less underuse. In settings with poor follow-up and tracking approaches, key informants found the tool useful. The rapidly changing delivery landscape posed significant challenges to this implementation research.
   Conclusion
   AT&Ftool did not significantly reduce adjuvant underuse but may help reduce underuse in SNHs with poor follow-up capabilities. Inability to discern T&F effectiveness is likely due to encountered challenges that inform lessons for future implementation research.

AB Instructions have long been considered a highly efficient route to knowledge acquisition especially compared to trial-and-error learning. We aimed at substantiating this claim by identifying boundary conditions for such an efficiency gain, including the influence of active learning intention, repeated instructions, and working memory load and span. Our experimental design allowed us to not only assess how well the instructed stimulus-response (S-R) rules were implemented later on, but also to directly measure prior instruction, encoding processes. This revealed that instruction encoding was boosted by an active learning intention which in turn entailed better subsequent rule implementation. As should be expected, instruction-based learning took fewer trials than trial and -error learning to reach a similar performance level. But more importantly, even when performance was measured relative to the identical number of preceding correct implementation trials, this efficiency gain persisted both in accuracy and in speed. This suggests that the naturally greater number of failed attempts in the initial phase of trial-and-error learning also negatively impacted learning in subsequent trials due to the persistence of erroneous memory traces established beforehand. A single instruction trial was sufficient to establish the advantage over trial-and-error learning but repeated instructions were better. Strategic factors and inter-individual differences in WM span - the latter exclusively affecting trial-and-error learning presumably due to the considerably more demanding working memory operations- could reduce or even abolish this advantage, but only in error rates. The same was not true for response time gains suggesting generally more efficient task automatization in instruction-based learning.

AB Forming implementation intentions (i.e., if-then planning) is a powerful self-regulation strategy that enhances goal attainment by facilitating the automatic initiation of goal-directed responses upon encountering critical situations. Yet, little is known about the consequences of forming implementation intentions for goal attainment in situations that were not specified in the if-then plan. In three experiments, we assessed goal attainment in terms of speed and accuracy in an object classification task, focusing on situations that were similar or dissimilar to critical situations and required planned or different responses. The results of Experiments 1 and 3 provide evidence for a facilitation of planned responses in critical and in sufficiently similar situations, enhancing goal attainment when the planned response was required and impairing it otherwise. In Experiment 3, additional unfavorable effects however emerged in situations that were dissimilar to the critical one but required the planned response as well. We discuss theoretical implications as well as potential benefits and pitfalls emerging from these non-planned effects of forming implementation intentions.

AB The interplay between inflexible habits and flexible goal-directed control can be modelled in lab-settings using the slips-of-action task. In this task, participants are required to selectively respond to still-valuable outcomes while suppressing responding towards no-longer valuable outcomes, thereby overriding learned stimulus response associations. Here we examined in the slips-of-action task whether learnt habits can be changed using a planning technique - so-called implementation intentions - whereby people instruct themselves to enact a certain behaviour (or not) in the presence of a specific critical stimulus. Such simple 'if-then' instructions have previously been shown to support behavioural change in real-life settings, possibly because people verbally create new stimulus-response associations. Across four experiments we manipulated the intrinsic value of the stimuli and outcomes in the slips-of-action task: abstract stimuli and outcomes (Experiment 1), snack food stimuli and outcomes (Experiment 2), or a combination of both types (Experiment 3-4). Implementation intentions improved the ability to suppress previously learnt responses towards no-longer-valuable abstract outcomes (Experiment 1 and 3). However, when snacks were used as outcomes (Experiment 2 and 4) no beneficial effect of implementation intentions versus goal intentions was observed. The slips-of-action task is thus sensitive to planning techniques under certain circumstances. Yet, the absence of effects when using snacks as outcomes implies the possible importance of its hedonic outcome value for implementation intentions' effectiveness, which warrants further investigation.

AB Aims and objectivesTo predict the factors that are most important in explaining nursing staff intentions towards early detection of the deteriorating health of a resident and providing subacute care in the nursing home setting.
   BackgroundNursing staff play a pivotal role in managing the deteriorating resident and determining whether the resident needs to be transferred to hospital or remain in the nursing home; however, there is a dearth of literature that explains the factors that influence their intentions. This information is needed to underpin hospital avoidance programs that aim to enhance nursing confidence and skills in this area.
   DesignA convergent parallel mixed-methods study, using the theory of planned behaviour as a framework.
   MethodsSurveys and focus groups were conducted with nursing staff (n=75) at a 94-bed nursing home at two points in time, prior to and following the implementation of a hospital avoidance program. The quantitative and qualitative data were analysed separately and merged during final analysis.
   ResultsNursing staff had strong intentions, a positive attitude that became significantly more positive with the hospital avoidance program in place, and a reasonable sense of control; however, the influence of important referents was the strongest predictor of intention towards managing residents with deteriorating health. Support from a hospital avoidance program empowered staff and increased confidence to intervene.
   ConclusionThe theory of planned behaviour served as an effective framework for identifying the strong influence referents had on nursing staff intentions around managing residents with deteriorating health. Although nursing staff had a reasonable sense of control over this area of their work, they believed they benefitted from a hospital avoidance program initiated by the nursing home.
   Relevance to clinical practiceManagers implementing hospital avoidance programs should consider the role of referents, appraise the known barriers and facilitators and take steps to identify those unique to their local situation. All levels of nursing staff play a role in preventing hospitalisation and should be consulted in the design, implementation and evaluation of any hospital avoidance strategies.

AB Watershed development has emerged as a crucial intervention to strengthen natural resource-based livelihoods in semi-arid areas in India. It has evolved from an infrastructure-heavy, top-down approach, into an increasingly participatory process aimed at building rural adaptive capacity to deal with climate change and other risks such as water scarcity and natural resource degradation. However, the efficacy of watershed development initiatives in building local adaptive capacity has not matched intention, and farmers remain exposed to unpredictable water supply. Against this backdrop of inadequate alignment between policy intention and outcomes, this paper examines whether participatory watershed development, as it is currently implemented, contributes to building farmer adaptive capacity. A case study of a watershed project in southern Rajasthan is used as an illustrative example. The findings demonstrate that watershed interventions focussed on hard adaptation options such as building check dams without a matching emphasis on soft adaptation approaches such as building inclusive institutions or incentivising sustainable resource use. In practice, community participation often reinforced existing power and gender-and caste-based hierarchies, raising questions of who benefits from participatory watershed projects and to what degree. Several non-project, macro-scale factors such as corruption and continued policy focus on water supply augmentation were found to undermine positive impacts of the watershed project. These findings suggest that without adequate empowerment, expectations that community participation will augment rural livelihoods, restore water-stressed ecosystems, and build adaptive capacity to climatic risks were found to be rhetorical. Thus, the study calls for a restructuring of watershed implementation that includes both hard and soft adaptation approaches, and allows for strategies that first empower and then engage communities in livelihood strengthening and resource stewardship.

AB The globalization of entrepreneurship education requires instructors to understand, and adjust the curriculum for, cultural disparities. This study investigates the impact of cultural norms on the attitudes of university entrepreneurship students in France and the United Statesregions with contrasting Hofstede and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor indices. It uses mind maps from students as culturally agnostic open-ended measures of their attitudes. Two mind maps were collected from each student, one on the appeal of entrepreneurship and one on the apprehension toward entrepreneurship, for a total of 1,213 concepts that were then scored using the Moore-Bygrave staged model of entrepreneurship to measure student likes and dislikes toward innovation, the decision to launch a start-up, new venture implementation, and venture growth. The Shannon entropy of a mind map was used as a measure of student fixation; lower entropy indicates the student is motivated or deterred by a subset of the curriculum, whereas higher entropy indicates that attitudinal components are more balanced across the curriculum. Participating students were enrolled in similar entrepreneurship courses, and exhibited attitudes with similar entropy. However, French students found the growth stage to be the most appealing and were most apprehensive about innovation, whereas U.S. students found innovation to be the most appealing stage and were most apprehensive about the growth stage, thus revealing different contextual drivers of learning and engagement with the educational materials. This research contributes to the advancement of entrepreneurship education in two ways. First, by using mind maps and differential model-based semantic scoring, it distinguishes between motivation and deterrence, and accounts for both cognitive and affective components of attitudes toward entrepreneurship. Second, it presents a formative assessment technique with which educators can measure students' cultural disposition to the different topics of an entrepreneurship course, and can then tailor the syllabus to this disposition. This technique can potentially improve the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education in multicultural settings, such as those involving educators, students, or course material from different regions and cultures.

AB Critical thinking is a higher order mental function influenced by social factors and performed within a social context. The aim of this paper is to suggest guidelines for critical thinking education on the grounds of social psychological theories of behavior change. Based on reviews of literature on the Reasoned Action Approach (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2011), and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986), this paper suggests that educators should direct learners' attention to concrete and good models of critical thinking as well as their positive consequences through various sources. Guiding learners to be mindful about social pressures and their own personal biases that inhibit critical thinking should also facilitate critical thinking in actual circumstances.

AB Objective Describe the process of enacting and defending strong tobacco packaging and labelling regulations in Uruguay amid Philip Morris International's (PMI) legal threats and challenges.
   Methods Triangulated government legislation, news sources and interviews with policy-makers and health advocates in Uruguay.
   Results In 2008 and 2009, the Uruguayan government enacted at the time the world's largest pictorial health warning labels (80% of front and back of package) and prohibited different packaging or presentations for cigarettes sold under a given brand. PMI threatened to sue Uruguay in international courts if these policies were implemented. The Vazquez administration maintained the regulations, but a week prior to President Vazquez's successor, President Mujica, took office on 1 March 2010 PMI announced its intention to file an investment arbitration dispute against Uruguay in the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Initially, the Mujica administration announced it would weaken the regulations to avoid litigation. In response, local public health groups in Uruguay enlisted former President Vazquez and international health groups and served as brokers to develop a collaboration with the Mujica administration to defend the regulations. This united front between the Uruguayan government and the transnational tobacco control network paid off when Uruguay defeated PMI's investment dispute in July 2016.
   Conclusion To replicate Uruguay's success, other countries need to recognise that strong political support, an actively engaged local civil society and financial and technical support are important factors in overcoming tobacco industry's legal threats to defend strong public health regulations.

AB In 2014, we established a pharmacogenetics unit with the intention of facilitating the integration of pharmacogenetic testing into clinical practice. This unit was centered around two main ideas: i) individualization of clinical recommendations, and ii) preemptive genotyping in risk populations. Our unit is based on the design and validation of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray, which has allowed testing of 180 SNPs associated with drug response (PharmArray), and clinical consultation regarding the results. Herein, we report our experience in integrating pharmacogenetic testing into our hospital and we present the results of the 2,539 pharmacogenetic consultation requests received over the past 3 years in our unit. The results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice within a national health system.

AB Does planning for a particular workday help employees perform better than on other days they fail to plan? We investigate this question by identifying 2 distinct types of daily work planning to explain why and when planning improves employees' daily performance. The first type is time management planning (TMP)-creating task lists, prioritizing tasks, and determining how and when to perform them. We propose that TMP enhances employees' performance by increasing their work engagement, but that these positive effects are weakened when employees face many interruptions in their day. The second type is contingent planning (CP) in which employees anticipate possible interruptions in their work and plan for them. We propose that CP helps employees stay engaged and perform well despite frequent interruptions. We investigate these hypotheses using a 2-week experience-sampling study. Our findings indicate that TMP's positive effects are conditioned upon the amount of interruptions, but CP has positive effects that are not influenced by the level of interruptions. Through this study, we help inform workers of the different planning methods they can use to increase their daily motivation and performance in dynamic work environments.

AB Annual chest computed tomography (CT) can decrease lung cancer mortality in high-risk individuals. Patient navigation improves cancer screening rates in underserved populations. Randomized controlled trial was conducted from February 2016 to January 2017 to evaluate the impact of a patient navigation program on lung cancer screening (LCS) among current smokers in five community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with an academic primary care network. We randomized 1200 smokers aged 55-77years to intervention (n=400) or usual care (n=800). Navigators contacted patients to determine LCS eligibility, introduce shared decision making about screening, schedule appointments with primary care physicians (PCPs), and help overcome barriers to obtaining screening and follow-up. Control patients received usual care. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who had any chest CT. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients contacted, proportion receiving LCS CTs, screening results and number of lung cancers diagnosed. Of the 400 intervention patients, 335 were contacted and 76 refused participation. Of the 259 participants, 124 (48%) were ineligible for screening; 119 had smoked <30 pack-years, and five had competing comorbidities. Among the 135 eligible participants in the intervention group, 124 (92%) had any chest CT performed. In intention-to-treat analyses, 124 intervention patients (31%) had any chest CT versus 138 control patients (17.3%, P<0.001). LCS CTs were performed in 94 intervention patients (23.5%) versus 69 controls (8.6%, P<0.001). A total of 20% of screened patients required follow-up. Lung cancer was diagnosed in eight intervention (2%) and four control (0.5%) patients. A patient navigation program implemented in CHCs significantly increased LCS among high-risk current smokers.

AB A part of scientific knowledge that aims to promote sustainable development consists in management principles of complex systems. Its implementation requires a precise understanding of the situation of action and of the actors' involvement in the situation. It can no longer be thought of in terms of transfer. Successful implementation relies on changing the ways of understanding and valuing the local context, as well as the actors' practices. Transdisciplinary approaches are proposed to facilitate mutual learning between researchers and local actors that lead to a better understanding of the action situation. We explore the benefits of such approaches and their implications for those involved in the field of agroecology. Agroecology is based on the implementation of scientific principles that aim to make agriculture more sustainable. These include the creation of agricultural production based on biodiversity. Analysis of three case studies concerning the biodiversification of forage production shows that implementation is not getting farmers involved in the researcher's project, but rather that researcher's intentions find a place in the farmer's projects. Researchers adapt their scientific production to the farmer's needs while farmers review their goals and means as a result of these interactions. The result is a better understanding of the situation to be transformed by both researchers and farmers. This new insight justifies making implementation an integral part of the scientific approach. However, both researchers and farmers committed to the situation need to be ready to leave their comfort zone.

AB Objective: Since behaviour is underpinned by both cognitive and automatic processes, psychological interventions aiming to instigate or modify habitual behaviour (cue-automaticity interventions) offer an alternative to the more commonly used (mainly educational) strategies to increase preventive healthcare use. Theory suggests that low socio-economic (SES) groups are especially likely to benefit. Cue-automaticity describes how repetition of behaviour, initiated by a particular 'cue', in a constant context, leads to the automatic instigation and/or execution of behaviour. Our primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of cue-automaticity interventions to improve the uptake of adult preventive healthcare, and to consider how this might be applied to the design of interventions to promote preventive dental visiting. Basic research design: An electronic search, with citation snowballing, of cue-automaticity interventions to influence adult preventive healthcare use was undertaken. Results: Searching identified 11,888 titles and abstracts. Paper screening left 26 papers, of which 6 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All 6 incorporated an Implementation Intention (I-I) component. Four studies involved cancer screening and 2 involved vaccination programmes. Five studies showed a significantly positive increase in preventive healthcare use, while one did not. Conclusions: Whilst few studies using cue-automaticity to underpin the promotion of preventive care use have been undertaken, studies that do exist have promising results. As cue-automaticity interventions may be of particular benefit to low SES groups, research is needed to investigate whether cue-automaticity interventions can translate into reducing inequalities in attendance for dental check-ups.

AB ObjectivesTo analyze the role played by resilience in the dimensions that constitute burnout syndrome and, through that, the psychological health of a sample of nurses working at hospital centers.
   MethodsCross-sectional design, with a questionnaire as the tool. The sample consisted of 537 nurses from three public hospitals in Murcia, Spain. The questionnaire contained measures of the following variables: resilience, the three dimensions of burnout (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy), and general psychological health, as well as sociodemographic and employment information.
   ResultsThe emotional exhaustion and cynicism dimensions of burnout were significantly linked to psychological health in the manner expected, but this was not the case for professional efficacy. A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed the moderating role of resilience on the emotional exhaustion and cynicism dimensions, as well as on psychological health.
   Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceThis study highlights the moderating role of resilience on burnout and psychological health. The practical implications of the results are discussed for the implementation of measures to increase resilience as a personal resource in order to improve the health and work performance of these professionals.

AB Background. E-health technology applications are essential tools of modern information technology that improve quality of healthcare delivery in hospitals of both developed and developing countries. However, despite its positive benefits, studies indicate that the rate of the e-health adoption in some developing countries is either low or underutilized. This is due in part, to barriers such as resistance from healthcare professionals, poor infrastructure, and low technical expertise among others.
   Objective. The aim of this study is to investigate, identify and analyze the underlying factors that affect healthcare professionals decision to adopt and use e-health technology applications in developing countries, with particular reference to hospitals in Nigeria.
   Methods. The study used a cross sectional approach in the form of a close-ended questionnaire to collect quantitative data from a sample of 465 healthcare professionals randomly selected from 15 hospitals in Nigeria. We used the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the dependent variable and external factors as independent variables. The collected data was then analyzed using SPSS statistical analysis such as frequency test, reliability analysis, and correlation coefficient analysis.
   Results. The results obtained, which correspond with findings from other researches published, indicate that perceived usefulness, belief, willingness, as well as attitude of healthcare professionals have significant influence on their intention to adopt and use the e-health technology applications. Other strategic factors identified include low literacy level and experience in using the e-health technology applications, lack of motivation, poor organizational and management policies.
   Conclusion. The study contributes to the literature by pinpointing significant areas where findings can positively affect, or be found useful by, healthcare policy decision makers in Nigeria and other developing countries. This can help them understand their areas of priorities and weaknesses when planning for e-health technology adoption and implementation.

AB Although the adoption of digital technology has gained considerable attention in higher education, currently research mainly focuses on implementation in formal learning contexts. Investigating what factors influence students' digital informal learning is still unclear and limited. To understand better university students' digital informal learning (DIL), this study proposed a model based on decomposed theory of planned behavior to investigate students' behavioral intention to DIL. Different aspects of DIL behavior were further explored, through examining behaviors of cognitive learning, metacognitive learning, and social and motivation learning. This study also integrated digital competence as a new construct into the model, along with other variables to test the proposed model. A sample of 335 students selected from three universities in China took part in this study. The partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. The results provide support and better understanding for the importance of motivation factors such as digital competence and compatibility to explain students' DIL.

AB Across 2 independent samples, we examined the relation between individual differences in rates of self-caught mind wandering and individual differences in temporal monitoring of an unrelated response goal. Rates of self-caught mind wandering were assessed during a commonly used sustained-attention task, and temporal goal monitoring was indexed during a well-established prospective-memory task. The results from both samples showed a positive relation between rates of self-caught mind wandering during the sustained-attention task and rates of checking a clock to monitor the amount of time remaining before a response was required in the prospective-memory task. This relation held even when controlling for overall propensity to mind-wander (indexed by intermittent thought probes) and levels of motivation (indexed by subjective reports). These results suggest the possibility that there is a common monitoring system that monitors the contents of consciousness and the progress of ongoing goals and tasks.

AB In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun instituting pay-for-performance incentives that reward hospitals based on patient-centric outcomes such as patient satisfaction. Further, to promote the "meaningful use" of health information technology (HIT), CMS has been prompting hospitals to adopt and use HITs. Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) is one such HIT and is designed to improve coordination in patient care teams and consequently patient outcomes. We explore the impact of CPOE-enabled coordination on patient satisfaction with the care team. In a departure from prior research that has tended to treat the team as all clinicians within a hospital unit/clinic, we conceptualize (and operationalize) patient care teams as ad hoc and patient-specific and thus comprised of those clinicians having direct contact with the patient. In a further departure from prior research that has employed lean measures of IS use (e.g., use intentions, duration, or frequency of use), we respond to the call for rich measures of IS use by conceptualizing deep structure use (DSU) of CPOE as patient care team-level usage of CPOE features.
   We draw upon adaptive structuration theory (AST) to identify faithfulness of appropriation (FOA) and consensus on appropriation (COA) as two related, but distinct, aspects of CPOE appropriation by patient care teams that affect DSU. We also draw on relational coordination theory to conceptualize communicative coordination (CC) as team communication for coordination purposes and theorize that DSU affects patient satisfaction through CC and informating the patient differentially across high/low patient mortality risk conditions.
   Based on data from 224 patient care teams caring for both low and high patient mortality risk conditions, our results indicate that FOA and COA are salient predictors of DSU, and that the effect of COA on DSU is mediated by FOA. We also observed a significant indirect effect of DSU on patient satisfaction (as mediated by communicative coordination and patient informating), but only for high patient mortality risk conditions. Our findings are important because they show that by using CPOE in a comprehensive manner, patient care team members are better able to coordinate patient care and are able to better inform the patient about their care, ultimately leading to improved patient satisfaction. Additional implications for HIT research and practice are discussed.

AB Using an online, cross sectional discrete choice experiment, we modeled the influence of 14 implementation attributes on the intention of 563 providers to adopt hypothetical evidence-based children's mental health practices (EBPs). Latent class analysis identified two segments. Segment 1 (12%) would complete 100% of initial training online, devote more time to training, make greater changes to their practices, and introduce only minor modifications to EBPs. Segment 2 (88%) preferred fewer changes, more modifications, less training, but more follow-up. Simulations suggest that enhanced supervisor support would increase the percentage of participants choosing the intensive training required to implement EBPs. The dissemination of EBPs needs to consider the views of segments of service providers with differing preferences regarding EBPs and implementation process design.

AB Background Media campaigns can potentially reach a large audience at relatively low cost but, to our knowledge, no randomised controlled trials have assessed their effect on a health outcome in a low-income country. We aimed to assess the effect of a radio campaign addressing family behaviours on all-cause post-neonatal under-5 child mortality in rural Burkina Faso.
   Methods In this repeated cross-sectional, cluster randomised trial, clusters (distinct geographical areas in rural Burkina Faso with at least 40 000 inhabitants) were selected by Development Media International based on their high radio listenership (>60% of women listening to the radio in the past week) and minimum distances between radio stations to exclude population-level contamination. Clusters were randomly allocated to receive the intervention (a comprehensive radio campaign) or control group (no radio media campaign). Household surveys were performed at baseline (from December, 2011, to February, 2012), midline (in November, 2013, and after 20 months of campaigning), and endline (from November, 2014, to March, 2015, after 32 months of campaigning). Primary analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, based on cluster-level summaries and adjusted for imbalances between groups at baseline. The primary outcome was all-cause post-neonatal under-5 child mortality. The trial was designed to detect a 20% reduction in the primary outcome with a power of 80%. Routine data from health facilities were also analysed for evidence of changes in use and these data had high statistical power. The indicators measured were new antenatal care attendances, facility deliveries, and under-5 consultations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, number NCT01517230.
   Findings The intervention ran from March, 2012, to January, 2015. 14 clusters were selected and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=7) or the control group (n=7). The average number of villages included per cluster was 34 in the control group and 29 in the intervention group. 2269 (82%) of 2784 women in the intervention group reported recognising the campaign's radio spots at endline. Post-neonatal under-5 child mortality decreased from 93.3 to 58.5 per 1000 livebirths in the control group and from 125.1 to 85.1 per 1000 livebirths in the intervention group. There was no evidence of an intervention effect (risk ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.82-1.22; p>0.999). In the first year of the intervention, under-5 consultations increased from 68 681 to 83 022 in the control group and from 79 852 to 111 758 in the intervention group. The intervention effect using interrupted time-series analysis was 35% (95% CI 20-51; p<0.0001). New antenatal care attendances decreased from 13 129 to 12 997 in the control group and increased from 19 658 to 20 202 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 6%, 95% CI 2-10; p=0.004). Deliveries in health facilities decreased from 10 598 to 10 533 in the control group and increased from 12 155 to 12 902 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 7%, 95% CI 2-11; p=0.004).
   Interpretation A comprehensive radio campaign had no detectable effect on child mortality. Substantial decreases in child mortality were observed in both groups over the intervention period, reducing our ability to detect an effect. This, nevertheless, represents the first randomised controlled trial to show that mass media alone can change health-seeking behaviours. Copyright (c) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Regenerative medicine is a novel discipline that both excites undergraduates and may be used as a vehicle to expose students to scientific concepts and opportunities. The goal of this article is to describe the implementation of a National Science Foundation-funded Targeted Infusion Project in which underrepresented minority undergraduates are exposed to laboratory-bench skills and summer research opportunities that they may not have encountered otherwise. A 3-wk infusion of laboratory-bench and data presentation skills, in the context of a regenerative medicine/bioengineering project, aimed to engage students and expose them to opportunities as summer researchers and teaching assistants. The infusion aimed to assess the extent to which students improved 1) attitudes toward laboratory-bench-based techniques, using attitudes toward science as a proxy; 2) perceptions of scientific inquiry; 3) intentions to engage in undergraduate research; and 4) intentions to persist in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields. Results indicate that the 3-wk infusion had no effect on science attitudes, but transcribed responses to structured interviews administered after the summer research experience indicated that students who completed summer research projects had positive experiences. Differences in intentions to engage in research were detected between groups of students in different STEM majors, in addition to differences in intentions to pursue a career in science. We describe the implementation of the infusion and briefly discuss quantitative outcomes. We conclude that infusion of laboratory-bench modules in the context of a regenerative medicine/ bioengineering project may play a small but important role in increasing (minority) participation and persistence in the STEM pipeline.

Imprinting theory helps to explain the impact that lessons learned and transmitted can have on the development of human resources in the family firm. However, the results of imprinting may not necessarily be positive, particularly when imprinting manifests itself in negative processes and expectations. Whereas imprinting and organizational learning are often associated with a "positive halo effect," they have the potential to result in negative behaviors and deleterious firm-level outcomes. Employing imprinting theory as a framework, we highlight the potential dark side of imprinting within the family firm context and how it can damage human resource efforts and threaten company performance and firm survival. Finally, we suggest how bad habits may be broken and replaced with more effective routines so as to ensure the family firm's continuity and success.

AB Background: Depression is the principal cause of disability in the world. High prevalence rates of depression in general populations and college students have been found worldwide and in various cultural groups. Low-intensity cognitive behavioural internet-delivered treatment has demonstrated efficacy in high-income-countries (HICs). However little is known of their potential for adaptation and efficacy in low and middle-income countries.
   Methods: Study (1) involves the cultural adaptation of the Space from Depression cognitive-behaviour internet-delivered programme with an asynchronous support for depressive symptoms. This includes initial researcher/clinician adaptation and the integration of cultural assessment feedback of the programme by a panel of experts and users through the theoretically-based Cultural Relevance Questionnaire (CRQ). Study (2) describes the implementation of the culturally adapted intervention using a randomised controlled trial methodology. The efficacy trial will include an active treatment group and a waiting-list control group of participants meeting eligibility criteria (mild to moderate depression symptoms). The active condition will consist of 7 weekly modules of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) Space from Depression, with post-session feedback support. The primary outcome will be the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The study also involves collection of client reported significant events and client satisfaction with the internet-delivered treatment. Data will be collected at baseline and at post-treatment (week 7), and at follow-up (week 20/3 months). Analysis will be conducted on the intention-to-treat basis.
   Discussion: The study seeks to establish a theoretically robust methodology for culturally adapting internet-delivered interventions for mental health disorders and to evaluate the efficacy of a culturally adapted internet-delivered treatment for depression in Colombia, with support. The study will be a first contribution to a method for culturally adapting internet-delivered interventions and also a first to examine the efficacy of such an adapted intervention in Latin America.

AB BACKGROUND
   A strategy of administering a neonatal rotavirus vaccine at birth to target early prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis may address some of the barriers to global implementation of a rotavirus vaccine.
   METHODS
   We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Indonesia to evaluate the efficacy of an oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) in preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy newborns received three doses of RV3-BB, administered according to a neonatal schedule (0 to 5 days, 8 weeks, and 14 weeks of age) or an infant schedule (8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age), or placebo. The primary analysis was conducted in the per-protocol population, which included only participants who received all four doses of vaccine or placebo within the visit windows, with secondary analyses performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who underwent randomization.
   RESULTS
   Among the 1513 participants in the per-protocol population, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred up to the age of 18 months in 5.6% of the participants in the placebo group (28 of 504 babies), in 1.4% in the neonatal-schedule vaccine group (7 of 498), and in 2.7% in the infant-schedule vaccine group (14 of 511). This resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 91) in the neonatal-schedule group (P<0.001), 51% (95% CI, 7 to 76) in the infant-schedule group (P=0.03), and 63% (95% CI, 34 to 80) in the neonatal-schedule and infant-schedule groups combined (combined vaccine group) (P<0.001). Similar results were observed in the intention-to-treat analysis (1649 participants); the vaccine efficacy was 68% (95% CI, 35 to 86) in the neonatal-schedule group (P=0.001), 52% (95% CI, 11 to 76) in the infant-schedule group (P=0.02), and 60% (95% CI, 31 to 76) in the combined vaccine group (P<0.001). Vaccine response, as evidenced by serum immune response or shedding of RV3-BB in the stool, occurred in 78 of 83 participants (94%) in the neonatal-schedule group and in 83 of 84 participants (99%) in the infant-schedule group. The incidence of adverse events was similar across the groups. No episodes of intussusception occurred within the 21-day risk period after administration of any dose of vaccine or placebo, and one episode of intussusception occurred 114 days after the third dose of vaccine in the infant-schedule group.
   CONCLUSIONS
   RV3-BB was efficacious in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis when administered according to a neonatal or an infant schedule in Indonesia.

AB This article tests low cost interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates. By changing an email announcement sent out to employees in 2014 (n > 30,000), the following interventions are tested: incentives, attention to the negative impacts of not get vaccinated, and showing a map to the vaccination centers at the end of the email announcement. Only the map condition helped increase influenza vaccination rates. The use of low-cost interventions can improve influenza vaccination rates though not all interventions work as well as others in the field. In particular, while including maps helped increase vaccination rates, other factors such as negative impact reminders and incentives, which previous studies have found to be successful in the laboratory, did not.

AB Background: Advance care planning (ACP) has been identified as particularly relevant for nursing home residents, but it remains unclear how or under what circumstances ACP works and can best be implemented in such settings. We aimed to develop a theory that outlines the hypothetical causal pathway of ACP in nursing homes, i.e. what changes are expected, by means of which processes and under what circumstances.
   Methods: The Theory of Change approach is a participatory method of programme design and evaluation whose underlying intention is to improve understanding of how and why a programme works. It results in a Theory of Change map that visually represents how, why and under what circumstances ACP is expected to work in nursing home settings in Belgium. Using this approach, we integrated the results of two workshops with stakeholders (n=27) with the results of a contextual analysis and a systematic literature review.
   Results: We identified two long-term outcomes that ACP can achieve: to improve the correspondence between residents' wishes and the care/treatment they receive and to make sure residents and their family feel involved in planning their future care and are confident their care will be according to their wishes. Besides willingness on the part of nursing home management to implement ACP and act accordingly, other necessary preconditions are identified and put in chronological order. These preconditions serve as precursors to, or requirements for, accomplishing successful ACP. Nine original key intervention components with specific rationales are identified at several levels (resident/family, staff or nursing home) to target the preconditions: selection of a trainer, ensuring engagement by management, training ACP reference persons, in-service education for healthcare staff, information for staff, general practitioners, residents and their family, ACP conversations and documentation, regular reflection sessions, multidisciplinary meetings, and formal monitoring.
   Conclusions: The Theory of Change map presented here illustrates a theory of how ACP is expected to work in order to achieve its desired long-term outcomes while highlighting organisational factors that potentially facilitate the implementation and sustainability of ACP. We provide the first comprehensive rationale of how ACP is expected to work in nursing homes, something that has been called for repeatedly.

AB Background: Adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances are at high risk of developing dental caries. To date, new smartphone technologies have seldom been used to support them in the preventive behavior that can help prevent dental caries. After an intervention-mapping process, we developed a smartphone application (the WhiteTeeth app) for preventing dental caries through improved oral-health behavior and oral hygiene. The app, which is intended to be used at home, will help adolescents with fixed orthodontic appliances perform their oral self-care behavior. The app is based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) theory, and incorporates several behavior-change techniques that target the psychosocial factors of oral-health behavior. This article describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of the WhiteTeeth app on oral-health behavior and oral-hygiene outcomes (presence of dental plaque and gingival bleeding) compared with those of care as usual, in patients aged 12-16 with fixed orthodontic appliances.
   Methods/design: The RCT has two conditions: an experimental group that will receive the WhiteTeeth app in addition to care as usual, and a control group that will only receive care as usual. Care as usual will include routine oral-health education and instruction at orthodontic check-ups. In the western part of the Netherlands 146 participants will be recruited from four orthodontic clinics. Data will be collected during three orthodontic check-ups: baseline (T0), 6 weeks of follow-up (T1) and 12 weeks of follow-up (T2). The primary study outcomes are the presence of dental plaque (measured with a modified Silness and Loe Plaque Index); and gingival bleeding (measured with the Bleeding on Marginal Probing Index). Secondary outcomes include changes in self-reported oral-health behaviors and its psychosocial factors identified by the HAPA theory, such as outcome expectancies, intention, action self-efficacy, coping planning and action control.
   Discussion: Since the intervention was designed to target psychosocial factors in the motivational and volitional components of the behavior-change process, we hypothesize that the app will cause greater improvements in oral-health behavior and oral hygiene more than traditional oral-health-promotion programs

AB Rationale and objectivesOne way to understand medical overuse at the clinician level is in terms of clinical decision-making processes that are normally adaptive but become maladaptive. In psychology, dual process models of cognition propose 2 decision-making processes. Reflective cognition is a conscious process of evaluating options based on some combination of utility, risk, capabilities, and/or social influences. Automatic cognition is a largely unconscious process occurring in response to environmental or emotive cues based on previously learned, ingrained heuristics. De-implementation strategies directed at clinicians may be conceptualized as corresponding to cognition: (1) a process of unlearning based on reflective cognition and (2) a process of substitution based on automatic cognition.
   ResultsWe define unlearning as a process in which clinicians consciously change their knowledge, beliefs, and intentions about an ineffective practice and alter their behaviour accordingly. Unlearning has been described as the questioning of established knowledge, habits, beliefs and assumptions as a prerequisite to identifying inappropriate or obsolete knowledge underpinning and/or embedded in existing practices and routines. We hypothesize that as an unintended consequence of unlearning strategies clinicians may experience reactance, ie, feel their professional prerogative is being violated and, consequently, increase their commitment to the ineffective practice. We define substitution as replacing the ineffective practice with one or more alternatives. A substitute is a specific alternative action or decision that either precludes the ineffective practice or makes it less likely to occur. Both approaches may work independently, eg, a substitute could displace an ineffective practice without changing clinicians' knowledge, and unlearning could occur even if no alternative exists. For some clinical practice, unlearning and substitution strategies may be most effectively used together.
   ConclusionsBy taking into account the dual process model of cognition, we may be able to design de-implementation strategies matched to clinicians' decision-making processes and avoid unintended consequence.

AB Mobile devices are increasingly coming to penetrate people's daily lives. Mobile learning (m-learning) is viewed as key to the coming era of electronic learning (e-learning). In the meantime, the use of mobile devices for learning has made a significant contribution to delivering education among higher education students worldwide. However, while m-learning is being widely adopted in developed countries, the adoption of such an approach in developing countries is still immature and underdeveloped. Developing countries are facing several challenges and lagging behind in terms of adopting m-learning in higher education. Thus, this paper explores the factors that have an impact on students' intentions and readiness to adopt m-learning in higher education in Jordan. Based on the data collected from the field, we examine Jordanian students' requirements and preferences in terms of m-learning design, and we also investigate their concerns about adopting m-learning. This empirical study collected data from students using a paper-based questionnaire. The results reveal that students' intentions to adopt m-learning is influenced by several factors that include the relative advantage, complexity, social influence, perceived enjoyment, and the self-management of learning. By providing a picture of students' willingness to adopt m-learning, this study offers useful and beneficial implications for developers of m-learning applications and for educational providers to guide the design and implementation of comprehensive m-learning systems.

AB Background: Socially assistive robots are being developed for patients to help manage chronic health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization.
   Objective: This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation, improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard care control group.
   Methods: At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60 patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted.
   Results: Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5%) than the control group (mean 29.5%, P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04). The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared with the control group (mean difference -4.53, 95% CI -7.16 to -1.92). There were no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the robot, 19 had favorable attitudes.
   Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that a homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be especially useful for patients struggling with adherence.

AB Crop insurance is a viable solution to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to risks from pest and disease outbreaks, extreme weather events, and market shocks that threaten their household food and income security. In developing and emerging countries, the implementation of area yield-based insurance, the form of crop insurance preferred by clients and industry, is constrained by the limited availability of detailed historical yield records. Remote-sensing technology can help to fill this gap by providing an unbiased and replicable source of the needed data. This study is dedicated to demonstrating and validating the methodology of remote sensing and crop growth model-based rice yield estimation with the intention of historical yield data generation for application in crop insurance. The developed system combines MODIS and SAR-based remote-sensing data to generate spatially explicit inputs for rice using a crop growth model. MODIS reflectance data were used to generate multitemporal LAI maps using the inverted Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). SAR data were used to generate rice area maps using MAPScape-RICE to mask LAI map products for further processing, including smoothing with logistic function and running yield simulation using the ORYZA crop growth model facilitated by the Rice Yield Estimation System (Rice-YES). Results from this study indicate that the approach of assimilating MODIS and SAR data into a crop growth model can generate well-adjusted yield estimates that adequately describe spatial yield distribution in the study area while reliably replicating official yield data with root mean square error, RMSE, of 0.30 and 0.46 t ha(-1) (normalized root mean square error, NRMSE of 5% and 8%) for the 2016 spring and summer seasons, respectively, in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, as evaluated at district level aggregation. The information from remote-sensing technology was also useful for identifying geographic locations with peculiarity in the timing of rice establishment, leaf growth, and yield level, and thus contributing to the spatial targeting of further investigation and interventions needed to reduce yield gaps.

AB Introduction and objective
   Lower urinary tract (LUT) and voiding dysfunction constitute a large percentage of pediatric urology referrals. Children with urinary incontinence unresponsive to behavioral modifications and traditional pharmacotherapy including anticholinergics and alpha blockers remain a challenge. We evaluated the impact of imipramine on treatment outcomes in children with refractory incontinence.
   Study design
   Children <= 18 years of age with refractory non-neurogenic daytime incontinence prescribed imipramine were identified. Patient demographics and baseline testing were assessed, as well as medication dosing and side effects of all patients. The Vancouver Symptom Score (VSS) was completed at the initial consultation and each subsequent clinic visit. The questionnaire was self-administered and completed by patients and/or parents. Treatment success was defined as per the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS).
   Results
   One hundred and three patients (55 males and 48 females) met the inclusion criteria. The intention-to-treat response rate was 65% (complete 44, partial response 23). Sixteen (15.6%) patients were non-responders and 20 (19.4%) were lost to follow-up. There was no statistical difference between all groups with regards to age, baseline VSS, and dose. Of those children with complete follow-up (n = 83), 44 (53%) experienced complete treatment response. Pre-and post-VSS were statistically different in both complete and partial response groups (complete 19.5-9.5; p < 0.0001; partial 19.7-13; p = 0.0002) (Table). Side effects were reported by 11 out of 83 (13.3%) patients; partial responders experienced a higher likelihood of side effects (26.1%; p = 0.03).
   Discussion
   The mainstay of LUT dysfunction management in children is implementation of a bowel program and timed voiding regimen, with additional treatment modalities and pharmacotherapy added depending upon prevailing symptomatology. Daytime incontinence refractory urotherapy, anticholinergics, and/or non-selective alpha blockers can be difficult to treat, and can be unresponsive to parasacral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). We observed that over half of children with refractory daytime incontinence reported complete resolution of daytime accidents with imipramine. Limitations of the study include the retrospective nature, relatively small sample size and lack of control group.
   Conclusions
   Two-thirds of children with refractory daytime incontinence experienced treatment response to imipramine, adding a valuable tool to the pediatric urologist's armamentarium in managing select, challenging patients.

AB The estimated impact of the EU Landing Obligation was investigated, which bans discards of regulated species, in South European fisheries through stakeholders' perceptions with the intention to identify implementation shortcomings and practicalities that might lead to obstacles to enforcement. Structured interviews were conducted with 173 fishers in 4 countries practicing 4 generic fisheries (as typified by the dominant fishing gear) asking a total of 26 questions. Results show that fishers estimate that the full implementation of the discards ban will result in longer sorting times. Added to the limited space on board, especially in the more productive trawl and purse seine vessels, this may lead to practical difficulties in relation to compliance. Most of the respondents estimate that there are no realistic possibilities of utilizing the formerly discarded fish in the short term, because of the lack of adequate infrastructure on land Furthermore, the possible utilization types foreseen in the regulation will not help offset the costs of bringing former discards to land. The outcomes of this study have confirmed the implementation difficulties of the landing obligation, especially when the fishing industry cannot expect any medium to long-term benefits.

AB As defined in the EU Water Framework Directive, every water tariff policy should be fair toward customers, generate legitimate revenue, and motivate consumers toward water saving. In the city of Chania, Greece, the inhabitants have asked for a fairer tariff policy and exhibited the intention to save water under the implementation of stricter measures. Therefore, a two-person zero-sum game was proposed, involving a conflict of interest between the Municipal Enterprise for Water and Sewage of Chania (MEWS) (Player 1) and the city's approximately 108,000 residents (Player 2). Three scenarios for the gradual reduction of the fixed charges and the gradual increase of volumetric charges were developed, assuming a different degree of change in water consumption behavior by each consumption block of consumers. The payoff matrices, for each scenario, incorporated two clear cost strategies for Player 1, in terms of changing the current tariff policy, and four clear cost strategies for Player 2, regarding the change in consumers' behavior. The optimal decision for both players, derived from the identification of the equilibrium point, demonstrated that domestic water consumption may be reduced by up to 4.6% while maintaining the MEWS's profit. The proposed model can provide a guide for other similar applications.

AB Background
   The relocation of formerly homeless patients eligible to transfer from a specialist homeless healthcare centre (SHHC) to mainstream general practices is key to patient integration in the local community. Failure to transition patients conferring eligibility for relocation may also negatively impact on SHHC service delivery.
   Aim
   To explore barriers and facilitators of relocation from the perspectives of formerly homeless patients and healthcare staff involved in their care.
   Design and Setting
   Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews conducted in the north east of Scotland.
   Method
   Participants were patients and healthcare staff including GPs, nurses, substance misuse workers, administrative, and local community pharmacy staff recruited from one SHHC, two mainstream general practices, and four community pharmacies. Interview schedules based on the 14 domains of the Theoretical domains Framework (TDF) were drafted. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by two independent researchers using a framework approach.
   Results
   Seventeen patients and 19 staff participated. Key barriers and facilitators aligned to TDF domains included: beliefs about consequences regarding relocation; patient intention to relocate; environmental context and resources in relation to the care of the patients and assessing patient eligibility; patient skills in relation to integration; social and professional role and identity of staff and patients; and emotional attachment to the SHHC.
   Conclusion
   Implementation of services, which promote relocation and integration, may optimise patient relocation from SHHCs to mainstream general practices. These include peer support networks for patients, better information provision on the relocation process, and supporting patients in the journey of identifying and adjusting to mainstream practices.

ID MEDICAL-RECORD; PRIMARY-CARE; IMPACT; QUALITY; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Within the framework of a broader e-health strategy launched a decade ago, in 2015 Switzerland passed a new federal law on patients' electronic health records (EHR). The reform requires hospitals to adopt interoperable EHRs to facilitate data sharing and cooperation among healthcare providers, ultimately contributing to improvements in quality of care and efficiency in the health system. Adoption is voluntary for ambulatories and private practices, that may however be pushed towards EHRs by patients. The latter have complete discretion in the choice of the health information to share. Moreover, careful attention is given to data security issues. Despite good intentions, the high institutional and organisational fragmentation of the Swiss healthcare system, as well as the lack of full agreement with stakeholders on some critical points of the reform, slowed the process of adoption of the law. In particular, pilot projects made clear that the participation of ambulatories is doomed to be low unless appropriate incentives are put in place. Moreover, most stakeholders point at the strategy proposed to finance technical implementation and management of EHRs as a major drawback. After two years of intense preparatory work, the law entered into force in April 2017. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives: The aims of the study were to evaluate satisfaction with the mammography service of the Local Health Unit RMA (Rome, Lazio Region) among women who have attended the program and to identify the predictors of participation.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: A telephone-based questionnaire was administered to women eligible for mammography screening. The respondents were randomly selected and interviewed by the health center staff.
   Results: A total of 502 women were interviewed, of which 264 (52.6%) have attended the screening program at least once. The attendees received the invitation letter more often than the non-attendees (88.3% vs 77.7%; P = 0.002), weremore willing to participate (85.6% vs 69.3%; P = 0.001), they considered the letter very clear (15% vs 10.8%; P = 0.003), and information obtained through the hotline appropriate (64.7% vs 56.7%; P = 0.002). Overall satisfaction was high. Critical issues were lack of response from the hotline staff, medium-long waiting time for the results and further examinations. Age > 61 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.747; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.842e4.096), receiving the invitation letter (OR = 2.539; 95% CI = 1.519-4.242), and intention to participate (OR = 3.086; 95% CI = 1.938-4.915) were significantly associated with participation in the screening program.
   Conclusions: Women's satisfaction with mammography is an important aspect of service utilization. Implementation of strategies to reduce waiting time, increase operating hours, and improve the invitation procedure and the hotline service could enhance satisfaction and attendance rate.

AB Eliminating regular tillage practices in agriculture has numerous ecological benefits that correspond to the intentions of organic agriculture; yet, more tillage is conducted in organic agriculture than in conventional agriculture. Organic systems face more management challenges to avoid tillage. This paper identifies factors to consider when implementing no-till practices particularly in organic agronomic and vegetable crop agriculture and describes techniques to address these factors. In some cases, future research is recommended to effectively address the current limitations. The format includes a literature review of organic no-till (OrgNT) research and two case studies of Ontario organic farmers that highlight no-till challenges and practices to overcome these challenges. Cover crops require significant consideration because they are the alternative to herbicides and fertilizers to manage weeds and provide nutrients in the OrgNT system. Equipment requirements have also proven to be unique in OrgNT systems. In the future, it is recommended that researchers involve organic farmers closely in studies on no-till implementation, so that the farmers' concerns are effectively addressed, and research is guided by possibilities recognized by the practitioners.

AB The main goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing cordon pricing as a mitigation policy to curb traffic congestion in Abu Dhabi Island. Two research objectives are identified to address the research goal. First, this study examines the impact of cordon pricing on commuters' travel behaviour based on their socio-economic characteristics. Second, this study investigates commuters' willingness to pay to escape congestion on the roads of the city of Abu Dhabi. A stated preference survey was used to gather data, and the analysis was based on 6054 responses. Multinomial logit modelling, chi-square test, and one-way ANOVA were used to assess the impact of cordon pricing on commuters. The results of this study show that the respondents have a slight intention to reduce their auto use by driving less or changing to other modes of transportation. Toll charges are found to be an important factor that would trigger some income groups to change their travel behaviour because of the additional burden and cost to their daily trips.

AB There is an enormous untapped potential for hydropower generation in rivers with large head and high flow variation, currently not feasible for conventional hydropower dams. Conventional dams make use of the potential energy, but waste kinetic energy from spillage during periods of high flows. This article studies the possibility of harnessing energy from potential and kinetic energy from hydropower dams with large head and flow variation, analyses its potential, and shows possible technologies. Focus is given to a Moveable Hydro Electric Power Plant (HEPP) system in which the turbine module can be adjusted according to the flow and water level in the river. During floods the exceeding flows can pass above and below the Moveable HEPP results in a sub-pressure environment after the turbine module, thereby reducing the dam's downstream head, increasing the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and outlet and the flow through the turbine, which increases the electricity generation of the dam. Dams with head increaser arrangement have been implemented in several dams in the 1930-1950s and now are regaining attention in Middle Europe. The main intention for its implementation is harnessing hydropower generation at run-of-river plants, with low-head, with a 20%-30% cost reduction, lower flooded area at the dam site, the resulting evaporation and the impact on the aquatic fauna.
   A case study was performed with the proposal of the Aripuand Moveable HEPP in the Madeira River with a 26 ms height dam and a generation capacity of 1400 MW. The increase in generation with the head increaser effect is as high as 21%. The estimated potential for this technology in the Amazon region is 20 GW. Other potential locations are discussed in the article. Dams with head increaser effect have been successfully implemented and have the potential to become a major alternative for base load renewable energy in the future.

AB Accelerating the rate of electric vehicle (EV) adoption is an objective of many countries to mitigate and ameliorate negative externalities arising from the use of fossil fuels for personal motorised transportation including: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution and noise, as well as increasing energy security and reducing budget deficits. Within the dynamic field of EVs, this paper highlights strategic directions for policy makers to increase EV uptake. The paper critically reviews measures adopted by some industrialised countries to motivate consumer purchase of EVs rather than conventional internal combustion vehicles (ICVs). A key focus is the role of financial and soft incentives to encourage EV adoption. The analysis reveals that not all incentives are equally effective; an adequate recharger network appears to be a common concerning factor for EV adoption due to customer anxiety and vehicle limitations. Best practice strategies that could foster a faster transition to EV adoption include appropriate legislation, installation and maintenance of an adequate public recharger network, government procurement programs, and investment in information programs to accelerate the transition towards fossil free driving. The paper evidences how implementation of these strategies can affect overall adoption rates.

AB Reform of mathematics education has been in focus in many countries including those in major economic transition. This paper reports a segment of a study which was conducted in Bhutan, where a reformed elementary mathematics curriculum has been recently introduced. The reformed curriculum is based on social constructivism and its design has been influenced by the USA's National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards. This paper reports upon the planned teaching of a sample of elementary (primary) teachers in their implementation of the reformed curriculum. The data for this part of the investigation were aggregated from a qualitative survey of randomly selected elementary school teachers (N = 72) from 40 schools across the country. A set of 3 analytical rubrics, based on intentions embedded in the curriculum, was developed to analyse the alignment of teachers' planned sample learning activities with the intentions of the curriculum. Our conclusions are that while the curriculum's intentions might be meaningfully stated in the curriculum documents, implementation remains problematic because there appears to be a mis-alignment between curriculum intentions and classroom practices. For instance, teachers by not adopting evidence-based approaches recommended in the curriculum document and are continuing to deny students opportunities to achieve deep understanding in achieving national priorities. This paper also argues that the proposed analytical rubrics may be of value for Bhutanese mathematics educators and, with minor modification, educators in other contexts, as they critique planned and actual practices.

AB We examine the role of the audit committee in their oversight of whistle-blowing. Our study examines whether the quality of the audit committee, captured by its independence, expertise, and diligence, is associated with two whistle-blowing outcomes: the choice of reporting channel (external whistle-blowing versus internal reporting) and the likelihood of retaliation against the whistle-blower. Using a sample of internal and external whistle-blowing cases, we find that a high-quality audit committee reduces the probability that misconduct is reported externally relative to internally, and reduces the probability that a whistle-blower experiences retaliation. We further find that a higher-quality audit committee is associated with the implementation of a stronger internal whistle-blowing system, which in turn reduces the likelihood of external relative to internal reporting. Together, our findings suggest that a high-quality audit committee helps to ensure that whistle-blowing disclosures are received and resolved through internal channels.

SO IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL

DE Roadway lighting; light-emitting diode (LEDs); illuminance control
ID SYSTEM
AB Most street lights currently deployed have constant illumination levels or vary based on a predetermined schedule. However, with advances in lighting controls, intelligent transportation systems, and the efforts of transportation agencies at regional and national levels to better sustain and manage the transportation system by monitoring the roadway network, many different types of real-time traffic data are available; which enables the implementation of a traffic responsive outdoor light system. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) has proposed a class-based lighting control model based on a number of roadway parameters, some of which are traffic related. However, the adaptation of the available traffic data to the existing model is not obvious. In addition, the CIE model can be improved to better reflect traffic characteristics to increase energy efficiency of the overall street lighting system. The intention of this research is to quantify the relationship between real-time traffic, and roadway lighting and to develop a control strategy based on real-time traffic data in order to reduce light energy consumption, enhance safety, and maximize throughput of the roadway. Significant energy savings were observed when the proposed control strategy was implemented in two case studies using available lighting and traffic data for Washington, DC, and Montgomery County, MD, representing urban and rural roadway networks, respectively.

AB Fruit and vegetable intake is insufficient in industrialized nations and long-haul heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers are considered a particularly at-risk group. The aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of a multi-theory, dual-phase model to predict fruit and vegetable consumption in Australian long-haul HGV drivers. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of past fruit and vegetable consumption on model paths. A prospective design with two waves of data collection spaced one week apart was adopted. Long-haul HGV drivers (N = 212) completed an initial survey containing theory-based measures of motivation (autonomous motivation, intention), social cognition (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control), and volition (action planning, coping planning) for fruit and vegetable consumption. One week later, participants (n = 84) completed a self-report measure of fruit and vegetable intake over the previous week. A structural equation model revealed that autonomous motivation predicted intentions, mediated through attitudes and perceived behavioural control. It further revealed that perceived behavioural control, action planning, and intentions predicted fruit and vegetable intake, whereby the intention-behaviour relationship was moderated by coping planning. Inclusion of past behaviour attenuated the effects of these variables. The model identified the relative contribution of motivation, social cognition, and volitional components in predicting fruit and vegetable intake of HGV drivers. Consistent with previous research, inclusion of past fruit and vegetable consumption led to an attenuation of model effects, particularly the intention-behaviour relationship. Further investigation is needed to determine which elements of past behaviour exert most influence on future action. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction The purpose of the study is to evaluate delivery method and breastfeeding initiation in women enrolled in group prenatal care (CenteringPregnancy) and in traditional prenatal care. Methods Data were obtained from medical records of a hospital-based midwifery practice in south central Connecticut that offered both types of prenatal care programs. Medical information from 307 women enrolled in this practice was included in the analysis. Out of the 307, 80 were enrolled in group prenatal care. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, and previous and current obstetrical information from medical records formed the basis of comparison. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were carried out. Results Women in Centering had fewer planned cesarean sections (1.3 vs. 12.8%) and had a higher breastfeeding initiation (88.7 vs. 80.0%). However, Centering women were found to have a higher portion of unplanned cesarean sections (27.5 vs. 11.0%). Both the unadjusted and the adjusted odds ratios of having a cesarean planned delivery were lower in the group care. Women in Centering had 2.44 (95% CI 1.05, 5.66) times the odds of breastfeeding initiation compared to the odds for women in traditional prenatal care after adjusting for maternal age, smoking status, gestation and race. Discussion CenteringPregnancy can have positive impact for the woman and baby. This program implementation saw lower rates of elective cesarean sections and increased breastfeeding compared to women in traditional care.

AB Background:Health information technology (HIT) interventions developed to support patients' self-care for chronic diseases have become popular, but people may not always accept and sustain their use.Introduction:This study examined factors that affected patients' acceptance of a computer-based, chronic disease self-monitoring system over a 4-week period.Materials and Methods:A research model was developed to test the relationships between the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and subjective norm and the patients' behavioral intention to use the system (i.e., acceptance). Data were collected with surveys of 42 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension at baseline, 2 weeks after implementation, and 4 weeks after implementation. Path analysis was used for model testing.Results:Perceived usefulness affected behavioral intention indirectly at 2 weeks and directly at 4 weeks; perceived ease of use affected behavioral intention indirectly at 2 and 4 weeks; attitude directly affected behavioral intention at 2 weeks; and subjective norm affected behavioral intention indirectly at 2 weeks and directly at baseline and at 4 weeks.Conclusions:Patients' acceptance of HIT is affected by the factors proposed in our research model. It is suggested that healthcare stakeholders consider and address the effects of these factors and their variations over time before implementing HIT.

AB Despite the childhood benefits gained from engaging in adequate physical activity, Australian preschool-aged children are reported to spend little time being physically active. Parental planning is important to engaging preschool-aged children in physical activity. Behavioral barriers, normative support, and self-efficacy have been identified as key determinants of parental decision making. However, the interplay among these factors is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the role of these psycho-social variables on parents' planning and behavior for their preschool-aged children's physical activity. A survey at two points in time was conducted in 208 Australian parents (n = 139 mothers, M (age) = 36.43 years, SD = 5.04; n = 69 fathers, M (age) = 36.33 years, SD = 6.5) of children aged between 2 and 5 years. A conditional process analysis was conducted that integrates mediation and moderation analyses. The results showed that planning and behavioral barriers predicted behavior, with a moderation effect also identified; more planning helped compensate for barriers. Normative support predicted both planning and behavior. In addition, an interaction between normative support and self-efficacy emerged. Parents with high self-efficacy engaged in high levels of planning, independent of normative support. Low self-efficacy with low normative support resulted in the lowest amount of planning; however, in the absence of normative support a high level of self-efficacy could compensate for it. Current findings provide avenues for future research to develop interventions to test the efficacy of these mechanisms in promoting parents' ability to ensure preschool-aged children are active.

AB BackgroundCompletion of a delirium detection tool allows rapid management, which alleviates complications. However, these tools are often underused.
   AimsTo assess the effect of a knowledge transfer (KT) intervention on the completion of a delirium detection tool by nurses working with cardiac surgery patients. Secondary aims included describing completion rates per work shift, and patient characteristics associated with higher rates.
   MethodsIn a pre-post study, the intervention included a survey and focus groups to identify barriers to use of a delirium detection tool (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [ICDSC]). Nurses' suggestions for a KT activity and its implementation were also included. Using chi-square analysis and medical charts from 242 patients, we compared the pre- and postintervention rates of completion of the ICDSC.
   ResultsThe majority of nurses who completed the survey (n = 30) felt they had the knowledge, skills, and intention to complete the ICDSC. During the focus groups (n = 4), a need for information on delirium symptoms and its management was raised as a barrier. This barrier was addressed with the selected KT activity (clinical capsule and aide-memoire handed out to nurses [n = 24]). Across all work shifts, the completion rate was similar pre- and postintervention. Overall, the completion rate was lower during the day shift than the night and evening shifts. A higher rate was associated with the first three postoperative days, and longer hospital and intensive care unit stays.
   Linking Evidence to ActionA tailored intervention based on preidentified barriers and facilitators, using the Determinants of Implementation Behavior Questionnaire, and in collaboration with participants, has the potential to promote evidence-based practice.

AB Several large epidemiological studies have shown increasing trends on a number of indices of marijuana use among college age samples. This may be due to changing attitudes about marijuana use linked to legalization efforts. Interventions that can target problematic use on a broad scale are lacking. Recent research has shown that deviance regulation theory (DRT) can be used to design effective web-based substance use interventions. DRT relies on the interplay between perceived norms and an appropriately framed message about the given behavior. The current study examines the use of DRT to change marijuana use intentions. Participants (n = 694 college students) completed measures of marijuana use and marijuana use norms. They were then assigned to receive a positively framed message about marijuana abstainers or a negatively framed message about marijuana users. Following the manipulation, participants rated intentions to use marijuana over the next three months. Consistent with DRT, there was an interaction between message frame and marijuana use norms. The positive frame attenuated the association between marijuana use norms and use intentions. A negative frame resulted in the lowest levels of use intentions among those with low use norms. Results suggest that DRT may be used to modify use intentions in college students, a population that has shown increasing rates of use.
   Public Health Significance
   This research shows that a simple intervention, in which individuals receive positive information about nonmarijuana users or negative information about marijuana users may reduce their intentions for future use. However, the message is dependent on the individual's beliefs regarding the base rates of marijuana use in the population.

AB Quick detection of motor intentions is critical in order to minimize the time required to activate a neuroprosthesis. We propose a Markov Switching Model (MSM) to achieve quick detection of an event related desynchronization (ERD) elicited bymotor imagery (MI) and recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). Conventional brain computer interfaces (BCI) rely on sliding window classifiers in order to perform online continuous classification of the rest vs. MI classes. Based on this approach, the detection of abrupt changes in the sensorimotor power suffers from an intrinsic delay caused by the necessity of computing an estimate of variance across several tenths of a second. Here we propose to avoid explicitly computing the EEG signal variance, and estimate the ERD state directly from the voltage information, in order to reduce the detection latency. This is achieved by using a model suitable in situations characterized by abrupt changes of state, the MSM. In our implementation, the model takes the form of a Gaussian observation model whose variance is governed by two latent discrete states with Markovian dynamics. Its objective is to estimate the brain state (i.e., rest vs. ERD) given the EEG voltage, spatially filtered by common spatial pattern (CSP), as observation. The two variances associated with the two latent states are calibrated using the variance of the CSP projection during rest and MI, respectively. The transition matrix of the latent states is optimized by the "quickest detection" strategy that minimizes a cost function of detection latency and false positive rate. Data collected by a dry EEG system from 50 healthy subjects, was used to assess performance and compare the MSM with several logistic regression classifiers of different sliding window lengths. As a result, the MSM achieves a significantly better tradeoff between latency, false positive and true positive rates. The proposed model could be used to achieve a more reactive and stable control of a neuroprosthesis. This is a desirable property in BCI-based neurorehabilitation, where proprioceptive feedback is provided based on the patient's brain signal. Indeed, it is hypothesized that simultaneous contingent association between brain signals and proprioceptive feedback induces superior associative learning.

AB Service-based cloud applications are software systems that continuously evolve to satisfy new user requirements and technological changes. This kind of applications also require elasticity, scalability, and high availability, which means that deployment of new functionalities or architectural adaptations to fulfill service level agreements (SLAs) should be performed while the application is in execution. Dynamic architectural reconfiguration is essential to minimize system disruptions while new or modified services are being integrated into existing cloud applications. Thus, cloud applications should be developed following principles that support dynamic reconfiguration of services, and also tools to automate these reconfigurations at runtime are needed. This paper presents an extension of a model-driven method for dynamic and incremental architecture reconfiguration of cloud services that allows developers to specify new services as software increments, and the tool to generate the implementation code for the services integration logic and the deployment and architectural reconfiguration scripts specific to the cloud environment in which the service will be deployed (e.g., Microsoft Azure). We also report the results of a quasi-experiment that empirically validate our method. It was conducted to evaluate their perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived intention to use. The results show that the participants perceive the method to be useful, and they also expressed their intention to use the method in the future. Although further experiments must be carried out to corroborate these results, the method has proven to be a promising architectural reconfiguration process for cloud applications in the context of agile and incremental development processes.

AB This article investigates, through the country-of-origin effect and value-in-use lenses, how the implementation of digital services creates opportunities for cultural industries to expand internationally. We argue that intrinsic attributes of cultural content such as the capacity to entertain are difficult to parameterize because they are somewhat experiential and subjective. This means that extrinsic cues are essential to foreign consumers when making a decision to purchase digital services. We specifically evaluate the influence of Britishness, cultural distance, exoticness, brand image, and flag-brand congruence on the purchase intentions of consumers in foreign markets. This study employs a unique consumer dataset with information on the internationalization of British cultural digital services. The depth and breadth of the survey data collected through collaboration with a UK media industry partner with a globally recognised brand is significantly richer than data used in previous studies. In particular, the study exploits a survey with 5,200 usable data points from consumers residing in fourteen geographically dispersed countries. Findings support theoretical predictions that Britishness, cultural distance, exoticness, brand image and flag-brand congruence are positively linked to the purchasing decisions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB BackgroundPhysical activity (PA) is beneficial for all people, yet people affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) find regular PA challenging. These people may include individuals with the disease who have moderate-to-severe disability and their family caregivers. For researchers and clinicians to effectively promote PA among caregiver/care-recipient dyads with moderate-to-severe MS, a comprehensive understanding of the shared PA experiences of these dyads would be beneficial.
   ObjectiveWe explored shared experiences of caregiver/care-recipient dyads affected by moderate-to-severe MS about PA and directions for intervention.
   MethodsSix focus groups with 23 people with moderate-to-severe MS and 12 family caregivers were conducted. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach.
   ResultsThree major themes emerged as follows: (i) PA is a continuum, (ii) cycle of disengagement and (iii) cycle of adjustment. The first theme captured the dyads understanding that PA falls along a continuum ranging from highly structured to unstructured activities. Cycle of disengagement captured the experiences of dyads engaging in little or no PA. These dyads perceived internal and external issues as drivers of the cycle of disengagement, while availability of supportive programmes and services or people helped the dyads to break out of the cycle. When the cycle of disengagement was broken, the dyads described moving towards the cycle of adjustment, where they were able to learn skills and take action to incorporate PA into daily routines.
   ConclusionThis research highlights the need to adopt an integrative approach that acknowledges the caregiver/care-recipient dyad with moderate-to-severe MS as a focus for PA intervention.

AB ObjectivesExcessive alcohol consumption increases when students enter university. This study tests whether combining (1) messages that target key beliefs from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) that underlie binge drinking, (2) a self-affirmation manipulation to reduce defensive processing, and (3) implementation intentions (if-then plans to avoid binge drinking) reduces alcohol consumption in the first 6months at university.
   DesignA 2 (self-affirmation)x2 (TPB messages)x2 (implementation intention) between-participants randomized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up.
   MethodsBefore starting university, students (N=2,951) completed measures of alcohol consumption and were randomly assigned to condition in a full-factorial design. TPB cognitions about binge drinking were assessed immediately post-intervention (n=2,682). Alcohol consumption was assessed after 1week (n=1,885), 1month (n=1,389), and 6months (n=892) at university. TPB cognitions were assessed again at 1 and 6months.
   ResultsParticipants who received the TPB messages had significantly less favourable cognitions about binge drinking (except perceived control), consumed fewer units of alcohol, engaged in binge drinking less frequently, and had less harmful patterns of alcohol consumption during their first 6months at university. The other main effects were non-significant.
   ConclusionsThe findings support the use of TPB-based interventions to reduce students' alcohol consumption, but question the use of self-affirmation and implementation intentions before starting university when the messages may not represent a threat to self-identity and when students may have limited knowledge and experience of the pressures to drink alcohol at university.

AB Procrastination has been described as the quintessence of self-regulatory failure. This study examines the relationships between this self-regulatory failure and other manifestations of self-regulation problems, namely impulsivity and intrusive thoughts. One hundred and forty-one participants completed questionnaires assessing procrastination, impulsivity (in particular, the urgency and lack of perseverance dimensions), and intrusive thoughts (i.e., rumination and daydreaming). Main results show that urgency mediated the association between rumination and procrastination, whereas rumination did not mediate the relation between urgency and procrastination. Lack of perseverance mediated the association between daydreaming and procrastination, and daydreaming mediated the relation between lack of perseverance and procrastination. This study highlights the role of impulsivity and intrusive thoughts in procrastination, specifies the links between these self-regulation problems, and provides insights into their (potential) underlying mechanisms. It also opens interesting prospects for management strategies for implementing targeted psychological interventions to reduce impulsive manifestations and/or thought control difficulties accompanying procrastination.

   policies; Policy process; Implementation; Municipal health promotion;

ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS
AB Background: For more than 30 years policy action across sectors has been celebrated as a necessary and viable way to affect the social factors impacting on health. In particular intersectoral action on the social determinants of health is considered necessary to address social inequalities in health. However, despite growing support for intersectoral policymaking, implementation remains a challenge. Critics argue that public health has remained naive about the policy process and a better understanding is needed. Based on ethnographic data, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of a local process of intersectoral policymaking in order to gain a better understanding of the challenges posed by implementation. To help conceptualize the process, we apply the theoretical perspective of organizational neo-institutionalism, in particular the concepts of rationalized myth and decoupling.
   Methods: On the basis of an explorative study among ten Danish municipalities, we conducted an ethnographic study of the development of a municipal-wide implementation strategy for the intersectoral health policy of a medium-sized municipality. The main data sources consist of ethnographic field notes from participant observation and interview transcripts.
   Results: By providing detailed contextual description, we show how an apparent failure to move from policy to action is played out by the ongoing production of abstract rhetoric and vague plans. We find that idealization of universal intersectoralism, inconsistent demands, and doubts about economic outcomes challenge the notion of implementation as moving from rhetoric to action.
   Conclusion: We argue that the 'myth' of intersectoralism may be instrumental in avoiding the specification of action to implement the policy, and that the policy instead serves as a way to display and support good intentions and hereby continue the process. On this basis we expand the discussion on implementation challenges regarding intersectoral policymaking for health.

ID HEALTH; CARE; DRIFT; POLITICS
AB Background
   As in many health care systems, some Canadian jurisdictions have begun shifting away from global hospital budgets. Payment for episodes of care has begun to be implemented. Starting in 2012, the Province of Ontario implemented hospital funding reforms comprising three elements: Global Budgets; Health Based Allocation Method (HBAM); and QualityBased Procedures (QBP). This evaluation focuses on implementation of QBPs, a procedure/diagnosis-specific funding approach involving a pre-set price per episode of care coupled with best practice clinical pathways. We examined whether or not there was consensus in understanding of the program theory underpinning QBPs and how this may have influenced full and effective implementation of this innovative funding model.
   Methods
   We undertook a formative evaluation of QBP implementation. We used an embedded case study method and in-depth, one-on-one, semi-structured, telephone interviews with key informants at three levels of the health care system: Designers (those who designed the QBP policy); Adoption Supporters (organizations and individuals supporting adoption of QBPs); and Hospital Implementers (those responsible for QBP implementation in hospitals). Thematic analysis involved an inductive approach, incorporating Framework analysis to generate descriptive and explanatory themes that emerged from the data.

   Five main findings emerged from our research: (1) Unbeknownst to most key informants, there was neither consistency nor clarity over time among QBP designers in their understanding of the original goal(s) for hospital funding reform; (2) Prior to implementation, the intended hospital funding mechanism transitioned from ABF to QBPs, but most key informants were either unaware of the transition or believe it was intentional; (3) Perception of the primary goal(s) of the policy reform continues to vary within and across all levels of key informants; (4) Four years into implementation, the QBP funding mechanism remains misunderstood; and (5) Ongoing differences in understanding of QBP goals and funding mechanism have created challenges with implementation and difficulties in measuring success.
   Conclusions
   Policy drift and policy layering affected both the goal and the mechanism of action of hospital funding reform. Lack of early specification in both policy goals and hospital funding mechanism exposed the reform to reactive changes that did not reflect initial intentions. Several challenges further exacerbated implementation of complex hospital funding reforms, including a prolonged implementation schedule, turnover of key staff, and inconsistent messaging over time. These factors altered the trajectory of the hospital funding reforms and created confusion amongst those responsible for implementation. Enacting changes to hospital funding policy through a process that is transparent, collaborative, and intentional may increase the likelihood of achieving intended effects.

AB Background: Health worker compliance with established best-practice clinical and public health guidelines may be enhanced by customized checklists of care and clinical decision support driven by point-of-care data entry into an electronic health registry. The public health system of Palestine is currently implementing a national electronic registry (eRegistry) for maternal and child health. This trial is embedded in the national implementation and aims to assess the effectiveness of the eRegistry's interactive checklists and clinical decision support, compared with the existing paper based records, on improving the quality of care for pregnant women.
   Methods: This two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted in the West Bank, Palestine, and includes 120 clusters (primary healthcare clinics) with an average annual enrollment of 60 pregnancies. The intervention tool is the eRegistry's interactive checklists and clinical decision support implemented within the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) Tracker software, developed and customized for the Palestinian context. The primary outcomes reflect the processes of essential interventions, namely timely and appropriate screening and management of: 1) anemia in pregnancy; 2) hypertension in pregnancy; 3) abnormal fetal growth; 4) and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy. The composite primary health outcome encompasses five conditions representing risk for the mother or baby that could have been detected or prevented by high-quality antenatal care: moderate or severe anemia at admission for labor; severe hypertension at admission for labor; malpresentation at delivery undetected during pregnancy; small for gestational age baby at delivery undetected during pregnancy; and large for gestational age baby at delivery. Primary analysis at the individual level taking the design effect of the clustering into account will be performed as intention-to-treat.
   Discussion: This trial, embedded in the national implementation of the eRegistry in Palestine, allows the assessment of process and health outcomes in a large-scale pragmatic setting. Findings will inform the use of interactive checklists and clinical decision support driven by point-of-care data entry into an eRegistry as a health systems-strengthening approach.

AB The Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) are voluntary tools with which companies manage the environmental aspects of their operations. In Europe, the most widespread are the ISO 14001:2015 international standard and the one defined by the European Regulation EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme). During the last years, while the number of ISO 14001 certified organizations has constantly grown, EMAS registered organizations have been declining. This phenomenon has occurred also in Italy, which accounts for roughly one-fourth of the 4000 European registrations. Only few scholars have explored this phenomenon and the existing relationship between EMAS outcomes and the decision to renew the Registration. Focusing on the Italian context, this paper aims at reducing this gap. The study presents the results of a survey, targeted to Italian EMAS organizations, that through a questionnaire investigates how the Scheme impacts on organizations' operations. Results have been analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Cluster Analysis and Binary Logistic Regressions, with the main goal to evaluate whether EMAS perceived benefits are significant in the decision to maintain the registration. Moreover, it explores the existence of significant linkages between organizations' characteristics and their willingness to renew EMAS. Findings show a significant predisposition to renew the registration, especially for small-sized organizations. Conversely, there is a negative link between renewal intentions and the possession of ISO 14001 certification. Finally, perceived benefits gained with EMAS implementation are not constantly significant predictors of the willingness to renew the registration. Despite the negative growth trend, the high levels of willingness to renew EMAS expressed by the respondents confirm the tool as a valuable resource and a solid baseline toward the implementation of more sustainable business models. Additionally, positive outcomes of EMAS such as the maximization of material productivity and energy efficiency, the creation of value from waste and the implementation of standardized environmental indicators may support organizations in the transition toward circular economy.

AB At the start of 2016, the 10 nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) entered a new era. With it, came the decade-old start of the implementation of the 2005 mutual recognition arrangement (MRA) on engineering services, and the free flow of skilled labor (FFSL). Although created with noble intentions, actual specifications and qualifications for an individual's foreign employment heavily restricts its actual implementation. This study, therefore, conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL 9.1 software of 278 engineers selected from a population of 1,211 Thai Federation of Industries companies to investigate how need, gap, and competency affect readiness. From the analysis, need was shown to have the highest effect on readiness, whereas competency also had a direct effect on readiness. Finally, the research determined that less than 1% of the surveyed engineers were certified as ASEAN engineers, which is a precondition for registration for work as an engineer in another ASEAN country, and that cultural awareness of other member nations was perceived as the weakest link in an individual's engineer readiness perception.

AB Before January 2016, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a new biomedical HIV-prevention tool, was only available in France via ANRS-Ipergay clinical study but informal use was reported outside this setting. PrEPage qualitative study reports profiles and experiences of participants who used PrEP outside of a biomedical trial before this prevention method was authorized. Between March 2015 and February 2016, a cross-section of twenty-four informal PrEP users, mostly MSM, was recruited to complete in-depth semi-structured interviews. While ANRS-Ipergay was still ongoing (2012-2016), participants described their initiation to PrEP, the way they used it and the difficulties they faced to acquire antiretroviral drugs in an environment where PrEP was still not widely known and often criticized. Through the testimonies, different user profiles and motivation toward informal PrEP use emerged: (a) participants who have increasing difficulties using condoms, (b) "opportunists" who tried PrEP without the intention of using it regularly and (c) participants with a risk aversion who sought additional protection against HIV. Participants chose to use PrEP and/or their usual prevention strategies depending on available supplies, type of partners and individual attitudes toward risk. The feeling of living a safer sex life helped participants to outweigh the fear of possible toxicity and drug resistance. Participants' needs and expectations about PrEP implementation in France were also presented.

AB Blended learning has been growing in demand and popularity and has become a common phenomenon in modern higher education systems, especially with the implementation of learning management system (LMS). This paper examined the effects of critical success factors on students' experience and satisfaction with the LMS in a blended learning setting. Certain characteristics of students, instructors, system, classmates, course design, and organization were identified from the literature as the main indicators of the LMS success. A total of 174 university students (94 males and 80 females) responded to an online questionnaire. A partial least square (PLS) approach was used for data analysis. The result showed that certain factors were found to influence students' perceived ease of use and usefulness of LMS and consequently their satisfaction. Findings from this paper provide the necessary insights as to how universities can enhance students' experiences and satisfaction of LMS in order to support the blended learning approach.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB This article examines the relationship between policy and practice for the teaching of children with English as an additional language (EAL) in English schools. It contributes original insights into how teachers are supported or restricted in developing the nuances of pedagogy needed for children new to English. The reported research took place against a backdrop of rising numbers of migrant children with EAL in English schools, partnered with a significant reduction in educational funding for these children and a limited focus on EAL in educational policy. Policy documents for EAL from two contrasting but contiguous periods of government were compared through an intertextual lens, and this was setalongside responses to a survey of teachers about their sense-making of policies and practices for EAL. Findings contribute to much-needed practical understanding of how policy enactment in practice may be divorced from policy makers' intentions. Outcomes provide a timely evidence-base which enhances our grasp of the complexity of teachers' professional lives in relation to children from different linguistic backgrounds. Moreover, analysis uncovers where policymakers' discourse reflects how children with EAL are perceived and received in their host countries during a period of hitherto unseen high levels of migration.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether the BikeSafe on-bicycle curriculum affects children's bicycle safety knowledge and collect cross-sectional data on cycling beliefs and attitudes.Methods: The University of Miami's BikeSafe program collected surveys from 286 participants, aged 7-15, in 10 Miami-Dade County Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces summer camps from June to August 2015. Pre and post knowledge assessments were analyzed for 83 intervention group and 57 control group participants. Posttesting occurred immediately following program implementation and 2-4 weeks postimplementation.Results: Intervention group participants demonstrated significant differences (P<.05) in knowledge gain between testing points, whereas control group participants did not. Participants (n=286) were more likely to be encouraged to ride a bicycle by parents/guardians (61.2%) than by friends (38.1%) or schools (19.6%). Older respondents reported lower intentions of helmet use compared to the younger age group, (2)(4)=27.96, P<.0005.Conclusions: Children's bicycle safety knowledge increased following implementation of the BikeSafe on-bicycle curriculum. This study confirmed previous research on the decrease in helmet use as children get older and provided insight into how children view their parents' beliefs and attitudes relating to cycling. The findings of this study can be used to effectively target future educational and encouragement initiatives.

AB Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior, this research investigates factors determining managers' intention to innovate contextualized within the situation of a new management practice implementation: telework. Managers' attitude toward telework, their attitude toward ideation and their perception of organizational support for creativity were identified as potential determinants of managers' intentions to innovate in order to implement telework. However, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, such effects are mediated by attitude toward innovative behaviors and perceived behavioral control. A sample of managers (N = 91) who never implemented telework completed an online questionnaire designed to assess these factors. Results from a path analysis confirmed the predictive model with the exception that attitude toward ideation had a stronger direct effect on attitude toward innovative behaviors than expected. Results are discussed in terms of their extension to the actual creation of innovative behaviors and their generalizability to decontextualized reported intentions to innovate, offering potential avenues for future research.

AB Cloud computing in healthcare has witnessed a major development in recent years due to its remote access capabilities among others. Studies have shown that it has attracted great attention in the field of healthcare. However, research studies show a number of healthcare consumers are yet to accept the technology, especially in developing countries due to reasons, such as the data security and the improper utilization of available information and communication technologies (ICTs) in healthcare. This paper therefore aims to identify factors affecting healthcare consumers' attitude toward the adoption of the cloud-based health center. Questionnaires were administered to 465 respondents in four locations in Benue, Nigeria with 76.9% response rate. The analysis of the data was conducted with statistical package for social science (20.0), factor analysis, and LISREL (9.30), was used to determine the structural path model. Using the social technical design approach, we developed the cloud-based health center which will provide access to healthcare services remotely to rural communities and reduce the cost/time of medical healthcare delivery when implemented into the Nigerian healthcare system. The results show that performance expectancy (beta = 0.31 and t = 5.80), effort expectancy (beta = 0.19 and t = 3.90), social influence (beta = 0.21 and t = 3.95), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.22 and t = 4.82), data security (beta = 0.15 and t = 3.07), and information sharing (beta = 0.11 and t = 2.53) had a significant impact on the behavioral intention of healthcare consumers. However, cloud-based health knowledge (beta = 0.09 and t = 1.49) was found to be statistically not significant. With these findings, healthcare policy makers must think carefully before the implementation of cloud-based health center. Otherwise, the integration will continue to create a challenge.

AB Supply Chain Management (SCM) aims to achieve organizational competitiveness. By including SCM paradigm and Information Technology (IT), companies aim to enhance their responsiveness and flexibility, and by changing their operations' strategy, they attempt to improve their competitiveness. This study focuses on the organizational variable, IT capabilities, technological structure, and possible antecedents and their impact on Supply Chain Technology (SCT) implementation. This paper proposes a model to examine the way, which SCT implementation affects IT enabled Organizational Performance (OP). The data were achieved through the questionnaires, and then they were analysed by using Smart PLS 3 program. The data collected from 118 employees in IT sector of Iran's customs administration provide strong support to the proposed research model. The results of this research showed that SCT implementation has a mediating effect on IT enabled OP improvement. Besides, the study revealed that IT capabilities have the most and organizational variable has the least influence on implementation of SCT. Based on other organization's situations, they can use the suggested model with a little changes.

AB ObjectiveTo compare the effects of laboratory-based training in implementation intentions (II; experimental strategy) and verbal rehearsal (VR; control strategy) on self-reported everyday prospective memory among people with Parkinson disease (PD) and to investigate potential correlates of change in self-reported everyday prospective memory in response to this training.MethodThis was a randomized-controlled trial. Participants with mild to moderate PD without dementia underwent one session of training in either II (n=25) or VR (n=27). Then they were instructed to use their strategy as much as possible in their everyday lives to help them remember to do things. The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire Prospective Scale (PRMQ-Pro) administered at baseline and one month after training assessed training-related change in self-reported everyday prospective memory. Baseline depressive symptoms, perceptions of the strategy (credibility, expectancy), prospective memory-related awareness, global cognition, and disease severity were correlated to PRMQ-Pro Change scores (post minus pre) to determine their association with response to training.ResultsThe VR group's PRMQ-Pro scores declined from pre to post training, while the II group's remained stable (p=.03). This effect was driven by change in self-cued everyday prospective memory tasks. Higher baseline depressive symptoms, treatment expectancy, and global cognition related to better response to training in the II group (rs-.40, ps.05).ConclusionsII training may prevent everyday prospective memory decline among people with PD. In addition, people with higher depression, stronger expectations of improvement from strategy training, or better global cognition may benefit the most from II training.

AB Milk is a highly perishable product, whose quality degrades while moving downstream in an imperfect cold dairy supply chain. Existing literature adopts a reactive approach for evaluating and preventing milk with a high microbial index from moving further downstream in a dairy supply chain. In this paper, we argue that such an approach is not the best response if the intention is to maximize milk life in terms of quality. We propose a proactive approach that monitors the metrics of the temperature and the level that are the building blocks of microorganisms in milk. This information is then used to determine the status at which the storage tank should hold the milk in accordance with standards. This status is then compared with the tank's actual status, and if they are different from one another, it will prompt the farmers to take the required preventive actions to manage the quality of milk. The developed proactive management of raw milk quality approach is modeled by using a rule-based system and machine learning techniques with a high level of accuracy. To test the validity of our approach and demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to a milk farm in Queensland, Australia.

AB Purpose This paper aims to describe the idea behind and design of a miniaturized distributed measurement system based on a controller area network (CAN) data bus.
   Design/methodology/approach The intention of the designers was to build a light and modular measurement system which can be used in remotely piloted aircraft systems and ultra-light aircraft during flight tests, as well as normal operation. The structure of this distributed measurement system is based on a CAN data bus. The CAN aerospace standard has been applied to the software as well as the hardware comprising this system. PRP-W2 software designed for PCs is an additional component of the proposed measurement system. This software supports data acquisition from a recorder unit and allows for preliminary data analysis, as well as data conversion and presentation.
   Findings The system, complete with a high-speed data recorder, was successfully installed on board of an MP-02 Czajka aircraft. A research experiment using the system and oriented on airframe high frequency vibration analysis is presented in the final part of this paper.
   Research limitations/implications This measurement system allows analysis of high-frequency vibrations occurring at selected points of the aircraft. A data set is recorded by three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes at frequencies up to 1 kHz.
   Practical implications The use of a miniature and lightweight modular measurement system will, in many cases, be faster and less expensive than full-scale measurement and data acquisition systems, which often require a lengthy assembly process. The implementation of this class of lightweight flight test systems has many advantages, in particular to the operation of small aircraft. Such solutions are likely to become increasingly common in unmanned aerial vehicles and in other light aircraft in the future.
   Originality/value The adaptation of a distributed measuring system with a high frequency of measurements for purposes of small and miniature aircraft.

AB Several innovations that can improve immunization systems already exist. Some interventions target service consumers within communities to raise awareness, build trust, improve understanding, remind caregivers, reward service users, and improve communication. Other interventions target health facilities to improve access and quality of vaccination services among others. Despite available empirical evidence, there is a delay in translating innovations into routine practice by immunization programmes.Drawing on an existing implementation science framework, we propose an interactive, and multi-perspective model to improve uptake and utilization of available immunization-related innovations in the African region.It is important to stress that our framework is by no means prescriptive. The key intention is to advocate for the entire immunization system to be viewed as an interconnected system of stakeholders, so as to foster better interaction, and proactive transfer of evidence-based innovation into policy and practice.

AB This article explores the potential of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to inform behaviour change research. A CAS describes a collection of heterogeneous agents interacting within a particular context, adapting to each other's actions. In practical terms, this implies that behaviour change is (1) socially and culturally situated; (2) highly sensitive to small baseline differences in individuals, groups, and intervention components; and (3) determined by multiple components interacting 'chaotically'. Two approaches to studying CAS are briefly reviewed. Agent-based modelling is a computer simulation technique that allows researchers to investigate 'what if' questions in a virtual environment. Applied qualitative research techniques, on the other hand, offer a way to examine what happens when an intervention is pursued in real-time, and to identify the sorts of rules and assumptions governing social action. Although these represent very different approaches to complexity, there may be scope for mixing these methods - for example, by grounding models in insights derived from qualitative fieldwork. Finally, I will argue that the concept of CAS offers one opportunity to gain a deepened understanding of health-related practices, and to examine the social psychological processes that produce health-promoting or damaging actions.

AB A steering control strategy based on bilateral torque fuzzy compensation for dual electric tracked vehicle is proposed in this paper. After the dynamic analysis of tracked vehicles, the mapping relationship between acceleration signal, braking signal, steering signal and bilateral motor torque is established. According to different driving states, the steering wheel real-time rotation angle and its change rate are interpreted as the motor torque compensation coefficients K1 and K2 by fuzzy algorithm to achieve quick response of driving intention. The steering control model of the electric tracked vehicle is built, and the HILS (hardware in loop simulation) platform is constructed with dSPACE. The HILS result shows that, by torque fuzzy compensation strategy, steering sensitivity and controllability could get better improvement compared with direct torque control strategy.

AB A rapid increase in the percentage of elderly people over the past few years has been a cause of serious concern among the research fraternity worldwide. Active research is being carried out to leverage the benefits of information and communication technologies that enable them to live independently and promote a sense of overall well-being. Smart-homes are often employed to assist this group of people. However, there is a serious lack of relevant exploratory research that tries to measure and explain the intention of these people toward using such a service. In this paper, we propose and validate a new comprehensive research model called the elderly smart home technology acceptance model by extending the original technology acceptance model that can explain the elderly intention to use the smart-homes. An online questionnaire survey is conducted for this purpose, the results of which are analyzed using the Partial least squares Structural Equation Modeling approach on data collected from 254 subjects. Subjective norm, compatibility, automation, self-capability, and satisfaction are positively related to the elderly intention in using smarthomes, whereas there is a negative association between affordability, security/privacy, and usage intention. Two other factors, namely universal connectivity and enjoyment, have no effect on the behavioral intention. The present study is a first empirical attempt that tries to explore the adoption of smart-homes among the elderly, as all other previous research has focused only on the technical aspects and implementation issues rather than the actual usage intention.

AB In this paper, the determinants of the intention to use online learning management system (LMS) among students in one of universities in the Kyrgyz Republic were studied, using quantitative and qualitative analysis. A total of 541 responses from students, enrolled in online courses during the fall and spring semesters 2016-2017, were used to examine students attitude toward online education. In addition, interviews with six instructors were conducted. Results showed that success of students in e-courses depend on year of education and the academic major of students. Factors, defined in the scope of this work, namely, technical characteristics of LMS, ease of use, feedback options of LMS and advantages of LMS use, were also found to be significant for students in their success in online courses. In interviews with instructors, three main points were highlighted, namely, problem with students' perception of online courses, lack of online education experience among instructors and administrative issues.

AB Conventional sampling plans are applied to dispose an individual lot or isolated lot that requires a large sample size. Consequently, the inspection time and cost needed to make a decision under conventional plans are high. In order to reduce the sample size and to inspect the series of lots with minimum cost and time, special purpose plans are utilized. In this article, we propose one of the special purpose plans, namely, a quick switching sampling system that is also known as a two-plan sampling system. Through this sampling system, the Weibull-distributed mean life of the product is ensured based on time-truncated life tests. The proposed system is designed with the intention of minimizing the average sample number using two points on the operating characteristic curve approach. The optimal parameters of the proposed system are determined for different combinations of producer's risk and consumer's risk. Implementation of the proposed system is also explained and the performance of the proposed system is compared with other existing plans. In addition, the effects of misspecification of shape parameters on optimal parameters and the probability of acceptance are discussed.

The intention was for the platform to be an agency for the development of reflection. The environment scaffolded reflection through (1) exemplars of good practice, (2) the opportunity for discussions and (3) activities to support the development of reflection. There were issues within the research around the introduction of the platform at the particular stage of the students' degrees but the environment was successful in the provision of a teaching and learning platform. The findings provided design principles for a model to guide the development of similar learning environments including (1) the need for the ePortfolio platform to be embedded across the degree programme with (2) regular tasks for the students to complete that (3) have a clear purpose that the students are aware of and (4) utilise interaction patterns that mimic the structures of social media.

AB The purpose of this empirical research was to use the perceived resources and technology acceptance model (PRATAM; Ku, 2009) to observe and measure students' beliefs on using the WebCT online learning system (OLS) in two WebCT courses offered at a large university in the south-eastern United States. PRATAM was replicated from previous research to address the factors of perceived resources (R), perceived usefulness (U), perceived ease of use (EOU), attitude towards using, behavioural intention to use (BI), and actual system use (USE). The results show that the constructs of PRATAM explained the data well in both surveys conducted. This study makes a contribution to the literature on PRATAM by identifying and understanding the factors that influence students' behaviours in response to the OLS. Moreover, it provides insights for administrators and instructional designers for improving students' persistence and retention in online learning courses.

AB In 2015, the New Zealand Ministry of Education released a new curriculum policy document for sexuality education in all schools - Sexuality Education: A Guide for Boards of Trustees, Principals and Teachers. This policy is a rare international example of a curriculum document that explicitly values diversity, promotes inclusive school environments, and approaches sexuality education as an area of study (rather than a health promotion intervention). Since its release, the document has, however, gained little attention either of a scholarly nature or in terms of dedicated implementation in schools. One exception is a recent article in this journal by Sarah Garland-Levett, which raises some interesting and important concerns about the possibilities of such policy documents. I follow her lead here and continue the discussion about the place and potential of progressive sexuality education policy, and offer some thoughts about the content and intentions of this text.

AB Purpose Although customer experience has been widely researched, its effects on behavior toward a government policy are still unclear. Drawing on two theories with some similar and opposing perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of three components of customer experience (i.e. utilitarian experience, hedonic experience and relational experience) and customers' intention on behavior within the context of the BVN policy implemented by the Nigerian apex bank.
   Design/methodology/approach Data emerged from one of the most populous districts in south-eastern Nigeria. Participants were recruited by mall-intercept. Out of the 283 participants approached, 246 participated but only 82.9 percent were valid for analysis. After subjecting data to statistical screening to confirm its suitability for parametric statistical analysis and examining data for the potential effects of common method variance as well as sample representativeness, a partial least squares structural equation modelling technique and the Preacher and Hayes bootstrapping procedures were utilized to test the hypothesized relationships.
   Findings Based on data obtained from Nigerian bank customers, the paper demonstrated that the customer loyalty arising from the implementation of a government policy is determined more by hedonic experience, followed by relational experience and very much less by utilitarian experience. Findings also indicate that the relationship between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty is complementarily mediated by intention to open new account(s).
   Research limitations/implications Though the theoretical grounding of the paper strongly supports the study design, the authors strongly recommend that future research should examine customer experience-customer behavior models in situations of policy implementation with longitudinal design. Additionally, since intention to open new account(s) is a complementary mediator of the links between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty, there is need for future researchers to integrate other mediators into the conceptual framework that the authors examined in this paper.
   Practical implications This paper cautions that whilst the research findings play out effectively in situations where the benefits of the introduced policy and the consumers' belief in the good intent of the policy are congruent and customers are susceptible to the manipulations of the social class leading to absence of volitional control; firms should not be deceived into relying too heavily on this kind of loyalty because it is situational and consequently promiscuous. Nevertheless, deploying more resources to seamlessly meet the needs of customers in such situations is counter-productive for service organizations.
   Social implications Based on the findings, it has come to the fore that consumers will be at the receiving end of a government policy poorly implemented by service organizations. When such policies are rolled out therefore, governments should enforce operational modalities that will forestall potential negative experiences that consumers could possibly encounter.
   Originality/value By examining the effects of three components of customer experience and intention to open new account(s) on customer loyalty within the context of BVN implementation in an emerging banking sector, the authors contribute to the broad stream of literature that focuses on the effect of customer experience on company bottom-line. The strength of this contribution is based on the premise that this paper draw on the similarities and opposing orientations of two theories to uncover these effects. The authors show that the effects of the three components of customer experience on customer loyalty is different from the results of previous research because of the unique perspective adopted in this paper.

AB Purpose Consumer experiences of healthcare services are challenging for researchers to study because of the complex, intangible and temporal nature of service provision. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel longitudinal three-phase research protocol, which combines iterative interviewing with visual techniques. This approach is utilised to study consumer service experiences, dimensions of consumer value and consumer value co-creation in a transformational service setting: complementary and alternative medicine healthcare.
   Design/methodology/approach This research employed a three-phase qualitative longitudinal research protocol, which incorporated: an initial in-depth interview, implementation of the visual elicitation technique Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique and a final interview to gain participant feedback on the analysis of data collected in the first two phases.
   Findings Four key benefits derived from using the three-phase protocol are reported: confirmation and elaboration of consumer value themes, emergence of underreported themes, evidence of transformation and refinement of themes, ensuring dependability of data and subsequent theory development.
   Originality/value The study provides evidence that a longitudinal multi-method approach using in-depth interviews and visual methods is a powerful tool that service researchers should consider, particularly for transformative service research settings with sensitive contexts, such as healthcare, and when studying difficult to articulate concepts, such as consumer value and value co-creation.

AB Purpose - Inspired by the theory of planned behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the big five personality (BFP) traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) on four aspects of individuals' knowledge management (KM) behaviors: knowledge acquisition, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey-based approach was used to collect data from 221 employees from five knowledge-intensive firms.
   Findings - The partial least square analyses confirmed a positive effect of two personality traits, openness and conscientiousness, on knowledge acquisition as well as knowledge application behavior. In addition, the positive effects of extraversion and conscientiousness traits on knowledge storage behavior were confirmed. The findings also revealed that agreeableness and openness traits positively relate to knowledge sharing behavior. Finally, neuroticism had a negative effect on knowledge acquisition and application behavior.
   Practical implications - This study suggests that organizations need to incorporate employees' personality into the design and implementation of their KM systems. The findings provide managers with insight into the course of personnel selection and retention to facilitate KM behaviors in organizations.
   Originality/value - Little is known about the relationship between the BFP traits and four aspects of KM behaviors at the individual level. The present study has contributed to the existing body of literature through clarifying how personality traits relate to four dimensions of individuals' KM behaviors.

AB In this paper, we propose to use brain-computer interface (BCI) to control a lower-limb exoskeleton. The exoskeleton follows the wearer's motion intention through decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and multi-modal cognition. Motion patterns as standing up, sitting down, and walking forward can be performed. We implemented two types of BCIs, one based on steady-state visual evoked potentials, which used canonical correlation analysis to extract the frequency the subject focused on. The other BCI is based on motor imagery, where the common spatial patterns method was employed to extract the features from the EEG signal. Then, the features were classified by support vector machine to recognize the intention of the subject. We invited four healthy subjects to participate in the experiments, including off-line and online. The off-line experiments trained the classifier and then were used online to test the performance of the BCI controlled exoskeleton system. The results showed high accuracy rate in motion intention classification tasks for both BCIs.

AB Background: Parental provision of alcohol to their underage child has been associated with risky adolescent drinking. While parents' belief in the appropriateness of providing their child with alcohol may influence their provision behaviors, research into the factors associated with this belief is lacking. Objectives: This study sought to identify the factors associated with parents' belief in the appropriateness of providing alcohol to their underage child. Methods: Western Australian parents of 12-17year olds (n = 443) completed an online survey assessing their drinking habits, alcohol provision behaviors, alcohol-related beliefs and attitudes, their child's alcohol consumption, and demographics. Results: Nearly half (44%) the parents surveyed reported providing their underage child with alcohol. Parents of older children and parents who (i) did not believe in the harms and recommendations associated with alcohol use in youth, (ii) agreed with youth-related drinking myths, and (iii) reported more occasions of alcohol consumption by their child were more likely to believe that it was appropriate to provide alcohol to their underage child. Those who believed providing alcohol to their underage child was appropriate were in turn more likely to provide alcohol. Conclusions: Interventions aiming to reduce parental provision of alcohol to children should focus on changing parents' beliefs that this is an appropriate harm minimization behavior. Belief change may be facilitated by the implementation of public education campaigns that increase parents' belief in the alcohol-related harms associated with youth drinking and debunk youth-related drinking myths.

ID LITIGATION
AB Most of the available evidence on patent assertion entities (PAEs) is coming from the United States, while little is known for Europe. The up-coming Unitary Patent (UP) and the Unified Patent Court (UPC) system are considered to be game-changing elements for strategic patent options and for patent assertion activity in Europe. Many patent practitioners are watching Europe as the future market place for patenting. PAE activity in Europe is increasing and one reason for this trend is that PAEs originating from the United States are becoming more active in Europe. In the future, fuzzy boundaries of patent claims in general and of software-related claims in particular, new combinations of technologies and enhanced interoperability under the schemes of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things could attract PAE activity in technological fields where it has not been seen before. Altogether, some of the features of the new UPC have the potential to play into the hands of PAEs in Europe. The future will much depend on the implementation of the new UPC system, how the different divisions of the court will establish case law decisions and how PAEs will make use of the new system. The intention of the article is to provide an overview of ongoing PAE activity in Europe and to assess the future strategic options of PAEs in Europe based on the design of the new UP and UPC system.

AB Data-based decision-making has the potential to increase student achievement results. Data-based decision-making can be defined as teachers' systematic analysis of data sources in order to study and adapt their educational practices for the purpose of maximizing learning results. Teachers must apply the findings from their data use to their personal teaching activities. Therefore, data-based decision-making may be influenced by individual teachers' psychological characteristics. The present study aimed to explore which psychological factors contribute to teachers' data use in a Dutch primary school context. A questionnaire-based quantitative methodology was employed. We included the following psychological constructs: affective and instrumental attitudes, perceived control, social norms, self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and intentions regarding data use. Results of the path analysis showed that perceived control, instrumental attitude, and intention regarding data use all significantly influenced data use. Additionally, intention was found to be a mediator of the relation between affective attitude and data use. Interventions aimed at data-based decision-making should take these psychological factors into account to increase teachers' implementation of data-based decision-making for instruction and, consequently, educational quality.

AB This paper presents a qualitative analysis about the determinants related to rescheduling travel mode decisions during the activity scheduling process. Notably, we were interested to study changes between intention and behavior. Data used came from an in-depth Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) follow up survey to habitual drivers carried out during the implementation of a panel survey. An interpretative qualitative method based on Analytic Induction was used to cope with the complex nature of rescheduling decisions and the characteristics of the data. The Theory of Planned Behavior has been used to gain a better understanding of the reasons associated with rescheduling travel mode decisions and to obtain a possible explanation of the phenomena studied. In our sample, 12 codes were identified as the main determinants of travel mode changing. Main reasons for rescheduling a travel mode are different considering gender, age, and the type of travel mode change. Main reasons for changing a nonprivate preplanned travel mode to a private travel mode are different considering the type of travel mode preplanned. New determinants of rescheduling decisions different from those associated with other activity scheduling decisions previously identified emerge when analyzing travel mode changes. A number of important sustainable transportation policies to reduce car use in urban areas are derived from the results of this study.

AB This research aims to study intentions to switch toward cloud computing at firms' level. As a new way to deploy information technologies (IT) within firms, switching toward cloud computing remains a hard decision that depends on several contextual factors. While several studies have focused mainly on technological aspects, this research adopts a multidimensional perspective by combining the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework with a two-factor theory perspective. Doing so, the authors attempt to propose a research model that can be useful to deeply understand how firms perform when thinking about switching toward cloud-based solutions. A multiple-case study within five Tunisian firms has been conducted to contextualize the research model and give it more explanation power. The Tunisian context should be interesting, as cloud computing adoption is a new topic that is not sufficiently studied in developing countries, particularly in those characterized by an economy in transition. Data have been collected by semi-structured interviews and coded using the Nvivo software. The analysis of interviews content shows that the expected switching benefits and risks play a mediating role between TOE factors and intentions to switch toward cloud computing. Indeed, the authors found some different results within cases revealing the dual effects of technology, organization, and environment factors on intentions by generating different expected switching benefits and risks. In light of these results, some recommendations are proposed to decision makers in this area.

AB The Realigning Agriculture for Improved Nutrition (RAIN) project was designed to address child undernutrition through a multisectoral approach which integrated agricultural diversification to improve access to nutritious foods, the promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment and nutrition behaviour change communication to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF) knowledge and practices. This paper presents the intention-to-treat impacts of the RAIN project on women's empowerment, IYCF knowledge and practices and child anthropometry. Findings on programme impacts on agricultural production, household food security and dietary diversity and maternal and child dietary diversity are reported elsewhere. The RAIN project had positive effects on women's empowerment, IYCF knowledge, child morbidity and weight-for-height z-scores, but had little impacts on IYCF practices, and no impact on stunting. Strengthening programme implementation and fostering higher participation rates could support greater impacts on child nutrition outcomes.

AB Robotics has entered food services for orders and deliveries. Robots not only attract customer's attention, but also solve the problems of human resource shortages, training, and turnover rates. For these reasons, restaurant robots may become staple in future culinary experiences. The present study attempts to study the perception of restaurant robots using technology acceptance model (TAM) with trust, interactivity, and quality of output as the variables. The interviewed subjects are general managers or deputy managers in more than 100 restaurants in Taiwan. The results indicate that attitude positively influences acceptance with perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use positively nudges attitude. Perceived ease of use significantly increases perceived usefulness. Trust and the quality of output significantly affect perceived usefulness, as does interaction has a positive influence on perceived ease of use. Finally, we hope this research result will shed some light on the future implementation of robotics in restaurant services.

AB Disability badly affects the performance of daily activities of a person thereby degrading the quality of his life. Physical rehabilitation can help restoration of the physical functions of such persons to a great extent. Numerous research are being performed for developing muscle models capable of estimating torque, joint angles, force, velocity etc. especially for upper and lower limb kinematics. This paper proposes three models for estimating elbow angle namely, Average Value model, a feed forward back-propagation neural network model and a Non-linear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous input (NARX) neural network model. All these models are studied with the sEMG signals acquired from the biceps brachii muscles of ten healthy subjects. The linear envelope of the signal is utilized for constructing two time domain features which serve as inputs to the models. The output of the models is the estimated elbow angles corresponding to the human intention identified from the sEMG signals. Regression coefficient values and Root mean square error values are considered for evaluating the accuracies of the models. The results obtained show that the models can be effectively used for implementation in control of human limb prosthetics and assistive devices.

ID IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; ATTENTION
AB Objective: Prospective memory (PM) has emerged as a form of episodic memory that is frequently impaired in a variety of clinical populations. Neuropsychologists who routinely evaluate these populations are often unaware of the possibility of PM deficits or the impact these deficits may have on everyday functioning. The objective of this special issue is to provide an overview of the nature of prospective deficits in a range of clinical populations, to discuss neuropsychological assessment techniques, and to critically evaluate management strategies. Method: We solicited papers from established researchers and issued a general call for papers for the special issue on PM in clinical populations. Results: We received submissions from the nine authors that we solicited. These submissions range from developmental disorders, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia; to disorders of adulthood, such as schizophrenia, HIV, brain injury, and multiple sclerosis; and finally disorders that tend to occur at older ages, such as Parkinson's disease and mild cognitive impairment. In addition, we have included four original research articles that provide novel data on other populations. These are children and adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia, individuals with mild brain injury, and individuals with idiopathic REM sleep behavioral disorder. Conclusions: The issue highlights the need for clinical neuropsychologists to be aware of the possible existence of deficits in PM in a variety of clinical populations and the importance of both assessment and management strategies to reduce the impact on daily life.

AB Objective: The current article set out to review all research conducted to date investigating prospective memory (PM) in autism. Method: All studies on PM in autism are first described, followed by a critical review and discussion of experimental findings within the multiprocess framework. PM in autism is then considered through an embodied predictive-coding account of autism. Results: Overall, despite somewhat inconsistent methodologies, a general deficit in PM in autism is observed, with evidence mostly in line with the multiprocess framework. That is, for tasks that are high in cognitive and attentional demand (e.g. time-based tasks; event-based cues of non-focality or low salience) PM performance of autistic participants is impaired. Building upon previous work in predictive-coding, and the way in which expected precision modulates attention, we postulate mechanisms that underpin PM and the potential deficits seen in autism. Furthermore, a unifying predictive-coding account of autism is extended under embodied predictive-coding models, to show how a predictive-coding impairment accounts not only for characteristic autistic difficulties, but also for commonly found differences in autistic movement. Conclusions: We show how differences in perception and action, core to the development of autism, lead directly to problems seen in PM. Using this link between movement and PM, we then put forward a number of holistic, embodied interventions to support PM in autism.

AB Objective: The effects of developmental dyslexia are not restricted solely to the processes involved in reading and spelling. Despite this broader impact on cognition, there has been very little dyslexia-related research on prospective memory (PM; memory for delayed intentions) until very recently. This paper focuses on reviewing a recent program of research which sought to explore this memory system in adults with dyslexia. Method: The review focuses mainly on studies of adults with dyslexia in which PM was compared with that of IQ-matched adults without dyslexia across clinical measures, computerized tests, self-report questionnaire, and more naturalistic tasks. Results: Across the reviewed studies, the adults with dyslexia showed a range of impairments in both laboratory and everyday settings. Dyslexia-related PM impairments occurred predominantly when cues to remembering were time-based rather than being cued by events in the environment, when delays to act upon the intention were prolonged, and when tasks were one-off events rather than being habitual. As well as being less accurate in their PM, the participants with dyslexia were also less likely to remember PM instructions over longer delay periods. Conclusions: PM deficits in dyslexia are considered in terms of the retrospective and prospective components of PM function. Less efficient access to verbal information in long-term memory, problems with time perception, and poorer executive functions are all considered as potential explanations for less accurate PM in dyslexia. The findings from the research program are linked to broader dyslexia theory and research. Some potential means for supporting individuals with dyslexia are considered.

AB Objective: Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to carry out intended actions in the future. Prospective forgetting has been shown to be one of the key cognitive impairments that contribute to medication non-adherence, reduced independence, and social dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia. This review aimed to provide an up to date appraisal of the nature and extent of PM impairments in individuals with schizophrenia and those who are at risk and to discuss clinical applications in this area. Method: We searched and reviewed relevant studies in this area between 2013 and August 2017. Results: Findings of studies conducted so far indicate that PM is severely impaired in schizophrenia. The most frequent type of PM errors in individuals with schizophrenia is no response, or failure to carry out the intended action. PM impairments in schizophrenia have been found to be related to everyday functioning. For individuals with schizophrenia, a number of assessment techniques have been developed to assess PM. These include: self-report questionnaires, computerized tasks, psychometric test batteries, and virtual reality tasks. So far, a few studies have used the compensatory approach to improve PM performance in individuals with schizophrenia and those who are at risk, and the results reported are promising. Based on findings of these studies, suggestions for the development of interventions for PM impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are provided. Conclusions: PM dysfunction is an important impairment in individuals with schizophrenia, and more rehabilitation studies to improve PM performance in these individuals are needed.

AB Objective: Prospective memory (PM) deficits have emerged as an important predictor of difficulty in daily life for individuals with acquired brain injury (BI). This review examines the variables that have been found to influence PM performance in this population. In addition, current methods of assessment are reviewed with a focus on clinical measures. Finally, cognitive rehabilitation therapies are reviewed, including compensatory, restorative and metacognitive approaches. Method: Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were used to identify studies. Studies were added that were identified from the reference lists of these. Results: Research has begun to elucidate the contributing variables to PM deficits after BI, such as attention, executive function and retrospective memory components. Imaging studies have identified prefrontal deficits, especially in the region of BA10 as contributing to these deficits. There are now several clinical measures available with good psychometric properties. Rehabilitation techniques have mostly focused on compensatory strategies, but, in addition, some restorative and metacognitive approaches have shown preliminary promise. Conclusions: PM deficits are a common and important deficit after BI. Clinical evaluation is recommended and further understanding of rehabilitation techniques is needed.

AB Problem: Graduate medical trainees must be prepared to practice in a quality-driven system that values adherence to and documentation of evidence-based care. Few validated approaches exist to teach these skills. Our objective was to develop, implement, and evaluate an ambulatory practice improvement curriculum capitalizing on peer feedback aimed at improving cardiology fellow guideline knowledge, adherence, and chart documentation. Intervention: Four outpatient topics were reviewed in dedicated 1-hour sessions: stable ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic valvular disease. Each session began with peer review, critique, and guideline adherence discussion of deidentified outpatient fellow clinic charts, followed by discussion of clinical guidelines. The open discussion of real clinic notes provided a forum for peer feedback exchange. Before each session and after the final session, participants completed a multiple-choice knowledge assessment and self-assessment of comfort with the guidelines. To evaluate the potential effect on patient care, random clinic chart audits were conducted before and after the curriculum using a chart scoring system. Context: Although the format is broadly applicable, the specific curriculum content was designed for a cardiology fellowship cohort in a large academic medical center. It was organized and implemented by 2 cardiology fellows under the direction and supervision of program directors. The curriculum was implemented during prescheduled noon conference hours. The intention was to carry forward this ambulatory curriculum in subsequent years and to use the first 4 sessions to study its potential successes and opportunities for improvement. Outcome: All 22 general cardiology fellows attended at least two sessions (M = 3.1). Knowledge test scores rose from 52.6% to 73.0% (20.4% increase, p < .001), 95% confidence interval (CI) [13.6%, 27.2%]. Self-reported guidelines knowledge improved by 15.1% (p = .002), 95% CI [6.2%, 24.0%], and self-reported documentation improved by 12.5% (p = .008), 95% CI [3.8%, 21.7%]. Chart audit scores improved by 17.8% (p < .001), 95% CI [10.6%, 25.0%], driven in part by 16.4% improvement in adherence to Class I therapies (p = .001). Lessons Learned: A targeted curriculum combining peer chart review, feedback, and guideline discussion was associated with significant improvement in fellows' knowledge and adherence to evidence-based therapies. Peer assessment and group-based education and feedback can be leveraged to improve trainee education and impact patient care.

AB Objectives: We sought to understand how pharmacists viewed and used a newly implemented prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). We also sought to understand pharmacist orientation toward dispensing of controlled substances and the people who obtain them. Methods: We conducted three mini focus groups. The focus group findings were used to inform the design of a structured survey. We emailed a survey to 160 pharmacists who were employed in one statewide community chain store; we obtained 48 survey responses. Results: Focus groups findings suggested that, in relation to the dispensing of scheduled prescription medication, pharmacists were either healthcare oriented, law-enforcement oriented, or an orientation that combined these two perspectives. Surveys suggested that pharmacists found PDMPs easy to use and that they used them frequently - often to contact physicians directly. Surveys suggested that pharmacists were typically either healthcare oriented or mixed (combined perspectives). Pharmacist orientation was associated with the frequency with which they counseled patients about medication risk and the frequency with which they used the PDMP as the basis for contacting prescribers. Conclusions: Ongoing tracking of pharmacists' use of PDMPs is important both at the implementation stage and as PDMPs develop over time. The orientation construct developed here is useful in understanding pharmacist behavior and attitudes towards patients potentially at risk for misuse of controlled substance medications. Further research on this construct could shed light on barriers and incentives for pharmacist PDMP participation and use and provide guidance for pharmacist training, ultimately enhancing patient care.

AB Background: Breastfeeding is proven to have lasting health benefits for both mothers and infants; however, 6-month exclusive breastfeeding rate remains below 20% in Thailand Although the number of research literature and commercial apps for breastfeeding women is significantly growing, they are country-specific and restricted to English-speaking users. There exists a major knowledge gap on how mobile health apps could support breastfeeding in Thailand To address these gaps, MoomMae has been developed with the intention to support Thai women in breastfeeding outside of their homes and in keeping their feeding records.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability and usefulness of MoomMae, a mobile phone app designed to support breastfeeding women.
   Methods: Our study was reviewed and approved by Thailand's National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) ethics committee. A total of 21 breastfeeding women with at least one Android phone or tablet were recruited via convenience and snowball sampling. The study process for each participant was as follows: the participant was requested to attend a preuse interview and given the app to use for 4 weeks. Following this period, a postuse interview was conducted to examine the usability and usefulness of the app. Both sessions were held individually and audiorecorded for qualitative analysis.
   Results: The mean scores of usability and usefulness from the postuse survey were 4.33 (SD 0.87; range 1-5) and 4.60 (SD 0.74; range 2-5). Our qualitative analysis revealed a total of 137 feedbacks: 71 related to usability and 66 associated with usefulness. A further sentimental analysis showed that comments on usability were generally negative (59 negative, 11 positive, and 1 neutral), and comments on usefulness were relatively positive (56 positive, 9 negative, and 1 neutral). We discovered 26 unique design issues and proposed recommendations for future improvement.
   Conclusions: Our usability and usefulness assessment of MoomMae demonstrated that MoomMae has a great potential to be a useful self-management tool for breastfeeding mothers in Thailand The qualitative analysis suggested that the app is supportive of breastfeeding on demand, but the flow and inputs of the app should be redesigned to be more intuitive. For future implementations, the most desirable feature is a pump-reminding notification system.

AB Health promotion programs represent a salient means through which physical activity promoters can cultivate positive health behavior change and maintenance. The messages communicated within these programs serve as an essential component as they are often used to convey valuable information, resources, or tools that facilitate health behavior initiation and sustained engagement. Identifying the most effective way to communicate health promotion information is, therefore, of considerable importance to ensuring that people not only attend to these messages, but also connect with and internalize the information conveyed within them. This paper was written to (1) summarize and evaluate the most prominent reviewed research approaches of message framing and tailoring to message design; and (2) offer a comprehensive messaging strategy to promote sustained health behavior change. A review of the literature demonstrated that a messaging strategy that has consistently led to healthy behavior change has yet to be identified. Furthermore, scholars have articulated that a multi-theoretical approach that places emphasis on facilitating motivation and healthy behavior change needs to be employed. Thus, this paper proposes and provides recommendations for employing the Comprehensive Messaging Strategy for Sustained Behavior Change (CMSSBC), which advocates tailoring messages to peoples' stage of change and framing them to focus on self-determined motives and intrinsic goals.

AB Preventing sexual assault on college campuses is a national priority. Bystander intervention offers a promising approach to change social norms and prevent sexual misconduct. This study presents the implementation and evaluation of a theory-based campaign to promote active bystander intervention. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) served as a conceptual framework throughout campaign development and evaluation. Formative research published elsewhere was used to develop campaign strategies, communication channels, and messages, including It is your place to prevent sexual assault: You're not ruining a good time. The It's Your Place multi-media campaign fosters a culture of bystander intervention through peer-to-peer facilitation and training, as well as traditional and new media platforms. A cross-sectional post-test only web-based survey was designed to evaluate the campaign and test the TPB's ability to accurately predict intention to intervene. Survey data were collected from 1,505 currently enrolled students. The TPB model predicted intention to intervene. There was a significant effect of campaign exposure on attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral intention. This theory-based communication campaign offers implications for promoting active bystander intervention and reducing sexual assault.

AB Introduction: Schools are making significant efforts to incorporate ICTs to their classrooms. However, integration requires structured projects that have an impact not only on infrastructure and resources, but also on plans for techno-pedagogical training, methodological innovation, leadership, management and coordination so that they can achieve their goal of improvement. This study aims therefore to analyze the characteristics of primary schools and secondary schools in the Community of Madrid, and the level of ICT skills among teachers to identify their needs. To do so, this study will be theoretically framed in the UNESCO Standards Teacher Training in ICT. Methodology: In order to fulfill these intentions, we have applied a questionnaire that allows us to determine which are the characteristics of the centers that influence in the profile of teachers and their digital skills effectively, making the process of integration and pedagogical use of ICT more effective. Results: In this study it is evident that teachers still do not have the digital skills needed to work with ICTs in the schools that were analyzed. Conclusions: The results suggest that the key aspects that affect the process of implementation and integration of technologies in a school are training in digital skills, techno-pedagogical coordination, methodological application designed from the school curriculum as well as effective leadership that would create a climate of acceptance towards technology as an element of educational innovation. In addition, these schools must make a major effort, through a techno-pedagogical project of integration, to equip their classrooms with the appropriate resources and organization/coordination in order to incorporate innovative learning activities in the classrooms.

AB The article analyses a topic of harassment and bullying in employees' interrelationship at the enterprises that strive for the status of corporate social responsibility or are socially responsible. Empirical research assesses criteria of employees' communication, isolation, reputation, demography, employees' attitudes, experienced harm, employees' feeling and intentions in regard to organization. This article presents only the research results that reflect the areas that require especially big attention. In the level of interrelationship, there remains a topical problem of psychological violence that negatively affects employees' health, work quality. Standardization of processes weakens managers' empathy to human relationship and their directional development in striving for favourable psychological climate at workplaces, and, in management, there is a focus into the use of power available. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) includes issues of enterprises' sustainability, environmental and employees' welfare, in the extent of which there are analysed employees' physical feeling and psychological states, impact of organizational climate on employees trust in enterprise's policy and employees' involvement into implementation of CSR initiatives. Involvement of organizations to tackling of social problems increases employees' productivity and decreases the cases of harassment, by affecting organization's general financial results at the same time.

AB IT training is firmly established as a key condition that influences successful technology adoption, yet little is known about factors that can affect voluntary training participation. We evaluate the predictive value of IT-related attributional style in relation to the intention to participate in voluntary training in the context of a mandatory enterprise resource planning system rollout. We find that individual IT-related attributional style is highly predictive of the intention to participate.

AB Background: Peer support is support provided by and for people with similar experiences. As students turn to peers for support with their mental health, peer support may provide an opportunity to engage students at an informal level and avoid some barriers to help-seeking.Aims: The study aimed to identify students likely to attend peer support and evaluate the acceptability and impact of the intervention.Methods: A six-part peer-led course for mild depression, based on behavioural activation and implementation intentions, was evaluated across eight UK universities with 65 students participating in the evaluation. The evaluation focused on mental wellbeing.Results: Participants were predominately female and had been experiencing anxiety or depression for more than one year. Most participants had already approached professional services for support. At least 57% of participants attended more than one session and 34% completed the course. Students with lower levels of mental wellbeing were more likely to complete the course. For students returning, there was a significant increase in mental wellbeing.Conclusions: Structured peer support for depression may have benefits in improving student mental wellbeing. However, this is unlikely to have a substantive effect in improving early and preventative intervention.

AB Increasing the role of community in the management of natural resources is a stated priority of ecologically sustainable development principles. Despite a proliferation of policy and legal requirements for public participation and non-legal guidelines that promote community access to environmental decision-making at both the international and national scale, implementation is often unsatisfactory and difficult to evaluate. For environmental managers, understanding both the potential and limitations of legal rules and policy requirements is important when evaluating the impact of reform efforts. Examining case studies of wind farm governance and natural resource planning in New South Wales, this article considers how legislative commitments to community engagement are experienced in practice. The intention is to move beyond a repetitive focus on how to run a good participatory process to a better understanding of how legislative and policy requirements can more effectively involve communities in natural resource governance. Results are presented within an analytical framework that distinguishes between legislation, policy, practice, evidence and reform elements of natural resource governance. The outcome is a better understanding of how legal requirements, audit and review mechanisms, best practice standards and guidelines can improve the quality and authenticity of community engagement in natural resource governance.

AB Objective: Self-affirmation has repeatedly been shown to reduce adverse psychological and physiological responses to stress. However, it is plausible that self-affirmation could exacerbate negative reactions to stress under certain conditions. The current research explored whether self-affirmation would increase negative psychological responses to a stressor occurring in a central life domain characterised by low levels of control.Design: Female participants (Study 1N=132; Study 2N=141) completed baseline measures of anxiety and mood. They were then randomly allocated to complete a self-affirmation or control task, before reading a narrative documenting a stressful birth and imagining themselves in the place of the woman giving birth. After completing this task, participants again reported their levels of anxiety and positive mood.Main outcome measures: Anxiety and positive mood assessed at follow-up.Results: Study 1 demonstrated that self-affirmed women experienced increased anxiety and less positive mood at follow-up, compared both to baseline and to women in the control condition. Study 2 revealed that the effect of self-affirmation on outcomes was moderated by fear of childbirth.Conclusion: These results provide preliminary evidence that self-affirmation may worsen negative responses to stressors under certain conditions and for certain individuals.

AB Objective: Exercise behaviour change involves multiple experiences with success and failure. The Model of Action Phases (MAP) offers a dynamic account of how success and failure influence both immediate evaluations and future decisions and actions. However, predictions from the MAP have not been formally tested.Design: A longitudinal daily diary study was used to examine how post-behaviour evaluations of exercise success and failure influence subsequent exercise intentions and behaviour. Participants (N=104) set exercise goals, and then kept a daily online exercise diary for four weeks.Main outcome measures: Participants self-reported exercise behaviour, affective response to exercise, self-evaluations after success or failure at following through on intentions to exercise, and intentions to exercise in the next week.Results: Multilevel modelling revealed significant within- and between-participant relationships among post-behaviour evaluations, intentions and subsequent behaviour. Findings supported MAP-derived predictions about how success and failure at exercise are associated with feelings about exercise and the self, and inform subsequent exercise intentions and behaviour.Conclusion: Positive post-behaviour evaluations of success or failure may stabilise positive intentions and aid maintenance of exercise behaviour. Implications of these MAP-based findings for intervention design are discussed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present findings of a study conducted to determine eReadiness status of public university libraries in Malawi to use mobile phones in the provision of library and information services.
   Design/methodology/approach The researcher carried out in-depth semi-structured interviews with university/college librarians and information and communications technology (ICT) directors using interview guides. Students were also administered with a survey questionnaire that contained closed- and some open-ended questions. Proceedings of the interviews were recorded using a tape recorder whilst backup notes were recorded in a notebook. Qualitative data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo software whilst quantitative data were analysed using SPPS.
   Findings The study findings revealed that institutions studied had the ICT infrastructure necessary for offering library and information services on the mobile phone platform. Moreover, students had mobile phones which were connected to internet to facilitate their access to services offered. However, the institutions covered by this study did not have operational ICT policies to govern the operations of library and information services offered through mobile phones although draft ICT policies were available. The study further concluded that though the human resources required to manage the provision of library and information services through mobile phones in the institutions studied were available, they did not have the necessary skills and numbers to provide quality services. Other findings revealed that attitudes of library staff and students to the offering and access to services through mobile phones were positive. The study also revealed that there are some factors that could impact the offering of library services through mobile phones.
   Research limitations/implications Although Malawi has four public universities, this study only focused on three of them. Moreover, academic staff is another important user group of academic libraries. In this case, findings reported in this paper only focus on students. This implies that library's readiness to offer services through mobile phones to this group remains unknown hence may have to be covered by future studies. Much as the study incorporated a quantitative strand in addition to the qualitative one, it neither involved theory testing nor confirmation as is the case with other related studies. This implies that the two theories used in this study (the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and the technology-organisation-environment) were not used in the strict sense, which is empirical at the core, but rather to put the problem studied in the context of other related studies.
   Practical implications The findings have practical implications in that they can be used for planning the implementation of library and information services through mobile phones in public university libraries in Malawi. Other related institutions can also use the findings as a reference point in planning the implementation of similar services.
   Originality/value Studies relating to the use of mobile phones in the delivery of library and information services have not been conducted in public universities in Malawi. Findings of this study will, therefore, inform researchers intending to conduct similar or related studies not only in public universities in Malawi but other related institutions as well.

AB Reducing meat consumption is an important element of an effective climate protection strategy, but meat consumption is highly habitualized and therefore difficult to change. This article uses an extended version of the theory of planned behavior with habit strength as additional predictor. In one longitudinal (N=227) and one prospective correlational study (N=212), attitudes toward and perceived ease of meat consumption reduction explained about 60% of variance of meat consumption reduction intentions, with habit strength being the strongest correlate of actual self-reported meat consumption. A third experimental study (N=192) demonstrated that implementation intentions can be an effective strategy for realizing reduction aims. We discuss the central role of habits for meat consumption.

AB Methods of diagnosing aerodynamic characteristics are constantly developing in order to conduct the precise and energy efficient wind tunnel testing of transport vehicles in the prototype design early stages. This is of a special importance when facing the time/cost consumption problems of detection of the transition zone over the simplified design of the high-speed train. Herein the applied thermodynamics found a very significant role in the field of experimental aerodynamics. With the intention of detecting the boundary-layer transition zone the following measurements were applied: the infrared thermography, flow visualization, and drag force measurements. In addition, the CFD was applied to predict the flow behaviour and transition zone, solving PDE consisting of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, energy equation, and the equation of state for an ideal gas employing density-based solver. The thermal imaging defined the transition zone by simple application, and fast recognition, while the transition bounds were defined in the analysis. The flow visualization confirmed thermography results and the method itself as favourable, especially in the most expensive early phases of redesigning for aerodynamically optimized and energy efficient solutions. The numerical method was confirmed by the experiments, resulting in acceptable differences in the definition of the transition zone. For a better understanding of the phenomenon, the overlapped implementation of the presented methods focused on forced convection showed as the best solution. Based on the experiences of this research, development of the additional equipment and adjustments will be introduced in the future experiments.

ID PARIHS FRAMEWORK; MELLITUS
AB Objective Conduct a formative evaluation to inform the implementation of 'Empowering Patients in Chronic Care' (EPIC), an evidence-based interdisciplinary group medical appointment intervention to improve collaborative goal setting in patients with treated but uncontrolled diabetes.
   Design The formative evaluation involved qualitative, in-depth interviews with clinicians, structured according to the Promoting Action on Research in Health Services framework. Interviews elicited (1) participants' knowledge regarding interdisciplinary group self-management and goal-setting programmes and how well clinicians embrace these interventions (evidence), (2) physical and social climate at each target facility and how the intervention can best he embedded into routine primary care (context) and (3) site-specific needs to be addressed by our implementation team and clinicians' preparedness and intentions to participate in the intervention (facilitation).
   Setting Clinicians were part of a primary care setting at one of five participating medical facilities within one Veterans Health Administration Veterans Affairs regional network.
   Participants We interviewed a snowball sample of 35 interdisciplinary clinicians engaged in diabetes management, practising leadership and administrators at target sites.
   Results Most participants had previous experience with diabetes group self-management programmes and viewed group appointments as an effective approach to enhancing care. Discussions about existing group appointments provided a context for evaluating potential harriers and facilitators to implementing EPIC into target sites. Interviews revealed clinicians' expectations about the roles they would play in the intervention, their assessments of the roles and strategies to facilitate their performance in those roles.
   Conclusions Successful implementation of evidence based practices into routine care requires a partnered approach with engaged local staff. The intervention should address local goals and research objectives to encourage bidirectional engagement. Robust partnerships are nurtured further by sustained, open communication and must consider the context, target population and local experience to address barriers and facilitators to implementation.

ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; FOLLOW-UP; PROGRAM REGISTER; COVERAGE;
   PERFORMANCE
AB Introduction Australia's National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) currently recommends 2-year cytology in women aged 18-69 years. Following a review of the NCSP prompted by the implementation of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, the programme will transition in 2017 to 5-year primary HPV screening with partial genotyping for HPV16/18 in women aged 25-74 years. Compass is a sentinel experience for the renewed NCSP and the first prospectively randomised trial of primary HPV screening compared with cytology to be conducted in a population with high uptake of HPV vaccination. This protocol describes the main Compass trial, which commenced after a pilot study of similar to 5000 women completed recruitment.
   Methods and analysis Women aged 25-69 years will be randomised at a 1:2 allocation to (1) 2.5-year image-read, liquid-based cytology (LBC) screening with HPV triage of low-grade smears (active control Arm A) or (2) 5-year HPV screening with partial genotyping and referral of HPV16/18-positive women to colposcopy (intervention Arm B). Women in Arm B positive for other oncogenic HPV (not 16/18) will undergo secondary randomisation at a 1:1 allocation to either LBC or dual-stained (p16(INK4a) and Ki-67) cytology testing (dual-stained cytology). The primary outcome is cumulative CIN3+ (CIN3, adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer) following a 5-year HPV exit testing round in both arms, in women randomised to the HPV arm versus women randomised to the LBC arm, based on an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome will first be tested for non inferiority and if declared, the primary outcome will be tested for superiority. A total of 36 300 women in birth cohorts riot offered vaccination and 84 700 women in cohorts offered vaccination will be recruited, bringing the final sample size to 121 000. The trial is powered for the secondary outcome of cumulative CIN3+ in screen-negative women, adjusted for censoring after CIN2+ treatmentand hysterectomy.
   Ethics and dissemination Approved by the Bellberry Ethics Committee (2014-11-592). Findings will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.

AB Background: Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) could be useful for delivering non-pharmacological therapies (NPTs) for dementia in nursing home settings.
   Aims: To identify technology-related expectations and inhibitions of healthcare professionals associated with the intention to use ICT-based NPTs.
   Design: Cross-sectional multi-method survey.
   Methods: N = 205 healthcare professionals completed a quantitative survey on usage and attitudes towards ICTs. Additionally, N = 11 semi-structured interviews were conducted.
   Results: Participants were classified as intenders to use ICTs (53%), non-intenders (14%) or ambivalent (32%). A MANCOVA revealed higher perceived usefulness for intenders compared to non-intenders and ambivalent healthcare professionals (V =.28, F(12, 292)= 3.94, p <.001). Qualitative interviews revealed generally high acceptance of ICTs in the workplace. Furthermore, benefits for residents emerged as a key requirement.
   Conclusion: Staff trainings should stress specific benefits for residents and healthcare professionals to facilitate successful implementation and acceptance of ICTs in nursing home settings.

AB I respond to the Behavioral and Brain Sciences commentaries on my book, Talking to Our Selves: Reflection, Ignorance, and Agency. I defend and amend both the skeptical challenge to morally responsible agency, that is, the book's impetus, and the anti-skeptical theory I develop to address that challenge. Regarding the skeptical challenge, I argue that it must be taken more seriously than some of my sanguine commentators assert, and consider some ways its impact might be blunted, such as by appeal to individual differences and the practical efficacy of human behavior. Regarding my positive theory, I defend the role of values in morally responsible agency against numerous criticisms, and consider various suggestions for elaborating my social, "collaborativist" account of morally responsible agency. In closing, I comment on the appropriate aspirations for theorizing about moral responsibility and agency.

AB Purpose - Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly used in cultural heritage tourism sites for the enhancement of the tourist experience. However, behavioral intention to adopt AR is dependent on cultural traits, and close investigation is required on cultural differences. To explore these cultural differences and the effect on AR acceptance in cultural heritage tourism sites, this study aims to focus on the aesthetic and hedonic characteristics of AR applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected in two countries with strong contrasts in Hofstede's cultural dimensions to explore cultural differences in AR acceptance. In total, 145 questionnaires were collected in Deoksugung Palace, South Korea, and 119 questionnaires were collected in the An Post Museum, Republic of Ireland. Data were analyzed using PLS Graph 3.0.
   Findings - The findings confirmed that the aesthetics of AR have a strong influence on perceived enjoyment. Furthermore, this study supported the notion that high power distance, collectivism and high uncertainty avoidance culture such as South Korea's perceives stronger dependence on social influence and the hedonic characteristics of AR.
   Practical implications - AR innovation and marketing within the hospitality and tourism industry requires an understanding of cultural differences to ensure successful implementation. In addition, tourism and hospitality managers need to ensure that the needs and requirements of different target markets are met.
   Originality/value - This study applied Hofstede's cultural dimensions to explore the differences between two very distinct countries with regard to AR acceptance. The findings provide important implications for the implementation of tourism AR applications for different countries, especially considering international target markets.

AB This qualitative inductive research explores the potential benefits for the Scandinavian economy and ports through the implementation of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as an alternative for container shipping to the established Southern route through the Suez Canal. To extract expert's opinions and address these objectives, we utilised in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews through purposive sampling in a single case study setting. The analysis of the data demonstrates that the commercialisation of NSR can yield benefits for the Scandinavian economy (e.g. GDP increase, jobs creation) and reveals the benefits of Scandinavian ports (e.g. ECA's, flexibility, hinterland, etc.) compared to other ports in North West Europe, which potentially grasp the NSR as an opportunity. However, it is highlighted that this can only be achieved if Scandinavian countries are proactive and secure their involvement.

AB The article provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the impact of competition policy on the national economy of a country with a developing culture of competition, through the effects of competition policy and the impact of deterrence of sanctions for breaches of competition. The theoretical analysis has revealed a positive relationship between a successful implementation of competition policy and the country's economic development. The article reviews the situation related to the implementation of competition policy in countries with developing/emerging culture of competition - Lithuania and Latvia. Quantitative research has shown that competition policy in countries with a developing/emerging culture of competition is mostly manifested through the same areas as in countries with a developed competition culture: the areas of innovation, investment, international trade and human resources. Qualitative research has shown that there is a positive tendency within countries with a developing/emerging culture of competition that more and more economic entities are ready to compete fairly, and the competition itself is considered as a value. In addition, while the deterrence from violations of competition law in countries with a developing/emerging competition culture is lower than in countries with a developed competition culture, the impact of an effective competition policy on the reduction of and deterrence from the intentions to violate competition is apparent.

AB The paper examined whether in-service teachers from Australia to Italy differ in terms of their attitudes, concerns, efficacy beliefs and intentions to include learners with disabilities in their classrooms. An attempt was also made to determine predictors of the participants' intentions to include learners with disabilities in their classrooms. Participants for the study consisted of 153 Australian and 156 Italian in-service teachers. Results revealed that Italian teachers had significantly more positive attitudes, lower degree of concerns and higher level of intentions to implement inclusion in their classrooms. In both countries, attitudes and efficacy emerged as significant predictors of participants' intentions to include learners with disabilities in regular classrooms. Reasons that could explain differences in the teachers' beliefs from the two countries are explained using historical-cultural and legal frameworks prevalent in Australia and Italy. Implications of the findings for policy-makers, university teachers and researchers are presented that may have relevance in guiding the implementation of inclusive education in Australia, Italy and beyond.

AB Self-set goals, selected by students for themselves, have known motivational benefits leading to increased autonomy and intrinsic motivation. In spite of the motivational benefits, students often fail to accomplish self-set goals because they lack the social motivator ascribed to assigned goals. The purpose of this research was to investigate methods of increasing students' commitments to self-set goals using implementation intentions: plans for when, where, and how to work toward a goal. The results of two studies revealed that implementation intentions increased students' performance on self-set goals relative to assigned goals through enhanced goal commitment and effort. Our findings suggest that the positive effects of self-set goals are greater when they are coupled with implementation intentions.

AB To evaluate the quality of reporting in published randomized controlled trials (RTCs) in the field of fall injuries. The 188 RTCs published between 2001 and 2011, indexed in EMBASE and Medline databases were extracted through searching by appropriate keywords and EMTree classification terms. The evaluation trustworthiness was assured through parallel evaluations of two experts in epidemiology and biostatistics. About 40%-75% of papers had problems in reporting random allocation method, allocation concealment, random allocation implementation, blinding and similarity among groups, intention to treat and balancing benefits and harms. Moreover, at least 10% of papers inappropriately/not reported the design, protocol violations, sample size justification, subgroup/adjusted analyses, presenting flow diagram, drop outs, recruitment time, baseline data, suitable effect size on outcome, ancillary analyses, limitations and generalizability. Considering the shortcomings found and due to the importance of the RCTs for fall injury prevention programmes, their reporting quality should be improved.

AB Background and objectiveSeasonal influenza is frequent among students and often responsible for impaired academic performance and lower levels of general health. However, the vaccination rate in this population is very low. As the seasonal influenza vaccine is not compulsory in France, it is important to improve the vaccination uptake by identifying predictors of both intention and behaviour. This study investigated the effect of decisional balance, motivation and self-efficacy on vaccination acceptance using the Extended Health Belief Model (HBM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT).Design and Main Outcome MeasuresUniversity students were invited to fill in an online survey to answer questions about their influenza vaccination intention, and HBM and SDT constructs. A one-year longitudinal follow-up study investigated vaccination behaviour.ResultsAutonomous motivation and self-efficacy significantly influenced the intention to have the influenza vaccine, and vaccine behaviour at one-year follow-up. Intention predicted a significant proportion of variation (51%) in behaviour, and mediated the effect of these predictors on vaccination behaviour.ConclusionThese results suggest that motivation concepts of the Self-Determination Theory can be adequately combined with the Health Belief Model to understand vaccination behaviour.

AB Low self-control is associated with increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and unhealthy food. This systematic review aimed to assess whether individual differences in self-control modify the effectiveness of interventions to reduce consumption of these products, and hence their potential to reduce consumption amongst those whose consumption is generally greater. Searches of six databases were supplemented with snowball searches and forward citation tracking. Narrative synthesis summarised findings by: consumption behaviour (alcohol, tobacco, food); psychological processes targeted by the intervention (reflective, non-reflective, or both); and study design (experiment, cohort, or cross-sectional). Of 54 eligible studies, 22 reported no evidence of modification, 18 reported interventions to be less effective in those with low self-control, and 14 reported interventions to be more effective in those with low self-control. This pattern did not differ from chance. Whilst self-control often influenced intervention outcomes, there was no consistent pattern of effects, even when stratifying studies by consumption behaviour, intervention type, or study design. There was a notable absence of evidence regarding interventions that restructure physical or economic environments. In summary, a heterogeneous, low-quality evidence base suggests an inconsistent moderating effect of low self-control on the effectiveness of interventions to change consumption behaviours.

AB This empirical study examines the role of gender diversity in top management teams (TMTs) and their impact on corporate social responsibility (CSR), which is an underexplored topic within the hotel sector. Based on stakeholder theory, we argue that the relationship between gender diversity and hotel performance is indirect and mediated by CSR. Our study also analyses how the implementation of total quality management (TQM) and CSR influences hotel stakeholder results, and hence business performance. Using a sample of Spanish hotels, we provide evidence that gender diversity in TMTs increases the level of implementation of CSR within the hotel industry. The results show that the impact of gender diversity on hotel performance is mediated by CSR. The findings also suggest that the adoption of TQM and CSR management philosophies improves the capacity of hotels to benefit their stakeholders, and that this improvement has a positive effect on hotel performance.

AB Background: European Union and national legislation implemented from May 2016 mean that from May 2017 all tobacco products in the United Kingdom must be sold in standardized packs without external branding and with prominent graphic health warnings. This study investigates the level of awareness and acceptability of the legislation in students during the implementation period, and how the legislation may impact on student perceptions of pack attributes, health warning effectiveness, student smokers' willingness to pay for cigarette packs, and intentions to quit.Methods: An online survey link was e-mailed to randomly selected University of Nottingham students in autumn 2016. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate awareness, acceptability, and potential quitting behavior.Results: 546 students (175 smokers, 371 nonsmokers) responded. Very few of students had seen a standardized pack. Smokers were more likely to be aware of the new legislation than non-smokers. More smokers noticed the warnings on standardized packs than on branded ones. Fewer smokers were willing to pay current prices for standardized packs than for 20 branded packs. Just under half of smokers anticipated quitting in response to the new legislation, with those who smoke infrequently being more likely to anticipate quitting than daily smokers.Conclusions: Few students had seen a standardized pack, suggesting that the level of implementation of the legislation was low five to six months into the implementation period. However, the findings suggest that the legislation has the potential to increase quitting behavior in smoking students.

AB Background: So far, training of prospective memory (PM) focused on very short instances (single sessions) and targeted the intention-formation phase only. Objective: We aimed to compare the effectiveness of 2 different 4-week strategy-based PM training types, namely imagery training (targeting the encoding of the PM intention in the intention-formation phase) versus rehearsal training (targeting the maintenance of the PM intention in the intention-retention phase) in older adults. Methods: We used a 4-week training protocol (8 sessions in total, 2 sessions per week). From the 44 participants, 21 were randomly assigned to the imagery training (vividly imagining a mental picture to memorize the connection between the PM cue words and related actions during intention formation) and 23 to the rehearsal training (rehearsing the PM cue words during intention retention). The criterion PM task was assessed before and after the training. Results: Comparing the effectiveness of both training types, we found a significant time by training type interaction on PM accuracy in terms of PM cue detection, F(1, 42) = 6.07, p = 0.018, eta(2)(p) = 0.13. Subsequent analyses revealed that the rehearsal training was more effective in enhancing PM accuracy in terms of PM cue detection than the imagery training. Conclusion: Strategy-based PM training in older adults targeting the maintenance of the PM intention in the intention-retention phase may be more effective in enhancing PM accuracy in terms of PM cue detection than the strategy targeting the encoding of the PM intention in the intentionformation phase. This suggests that for successful prospective remembering, older adults may need more support to keep the PM cues active in memory while working on the ongoing task than to initially encode the PM intention.

AB This research identifies, examines, and presents an empirical evaluation of the existing technology acceptance constructs as they relate to end-user participation in training programs. The analysis of technology acceptance constructs and their fit with the existing training paradigms suggests a significant positive correlation between training reactions and behavioral intention to use information technology. In addition, an extended modeling framework that includes a training reaction construct as an intermediary factor between the training paradigms and the existing technology acceptance constructs, as reflected in the UTAUT model, is introduced and evaluated. We find that the relationship between training reactions and behavioral intentions to use were partially mediated by facilitating conditions.

AB Purpose - China is establishing a social credit rating system with the aim to score the trust level of citizens. The scores will be based on an integrated database that includes a vast range of information sources, rating aspects like professional conduct, corruption, type of products bought, peers' own scores and tax evasion. While this form of gamification is expected to have dire consequences on brands and consumers alike, the literature in that particular area of interest remains non-existent. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework is suggested that highlights early on the risks and implications on brands and companies operating in that particular upcoming landscape.
   Findings - The gamification of trust that the social credit system focuses on presents potential risks on brand and consumer relationships. This in turn will affect brand sustainability vis-a-vis the expected drastic changes in the Chinese business landscape. This study suggests the strategies to follow which will be of high interest to companies, consumers, as well as to the Chinese authorities during and after implementation stage.
   Originality/value - This paper is amongst the first to discuss the potential effects of the Chinese social credit rating system on brands. The conceptual framework fills a sizeable gap in the literature and pioneers the discussion on potential dilemmas brands will be faced with within this new business landscape.

AB China has in recent years been actively engaged in multilateral diplomacy. From the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road initiative, Beijing is pursuing strategies and promoting norms that are viewed as concerted efforts by China to challenge some of the key institutional arrangements of the existing international order. This article seeks to discuss these contentious issues and assess the rationales, approaches and implications of Chinese diplomacy in initiating and promoting what can be considered as institutional-balancing strategies. The author suggests that the rationales behind these Chinese strategies have as much to do with Beijing's shifting priorities and the need to address them as with reflecting a degree of dissatisfaction with existing multilateral institutions. And there are more marked differences in Chinese motivations and modalities in security arenas than in economic areas. However, it would be overstating Beijing's intentions and capabilities if these China-sponsored initiatives are viewed as direct challenges to the existing international and regional orders.

AB Previous research informs us about facilitators of employees' promotive voice. Yet little is known about what determines whether a specific idea for constructive change brought up by an employee will be approved or rejected by a supervisor. Drawing on interactionist theories of motivation and personality, we propose that a supervisor will be least likely to support an idea when it threatens the supervisor's power motive, and when it is perceived to serve the employee's own striving for power. The prosocial versus egoistic intentions attributed to the idea presenter are proposed to mediate the latter effect. We conducted three scenario-based studies in which supervisors evaluated fictitious ideas voiced by employees that - if implemented - would have power-related consequences for them as a supervisor. Results show that the higher a supervisors' explicit power motive was, the less likely they were to support a power-threatening idea (Study 1, N=60). Moreover, idea support was less likely when this idea was proposed by an employee that was described as high (rather than low) on power motivation (Study 2, N=79); attributed prosocial intentions mediated this effect. Study 3 (N=260) replicates these results.

AB Objective. Activity patterns are the product of pain and of the self-regulation of current goals in the context of pain.) The aim of this study was to investigate the association between goal management strategies and activity patterns while taking into account the role of optimism/pessimism and positive/negative affect. Methods. Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain filled out questionnaires on optimism, positive and negative affect, pain intensity, and the activity patterns they employed in dealing with their pain. Questionnaires were also administered to assess their general goal management strategies: goal persistence, flexible goal adjustment, and disengagement and reengagement with goals. Results. Structural equation modelling showed that higher levels of optimism were related to persistence, flexible goal management, and commitment to new goals.) These strategies were associated with higher positive affect, persistence in finishing tasks despite pain, and infrequent avoidance behaviour in the presence or anticipation of pain. Conclusions.) The strategies used by the patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain to manage their life goals are related to their activity patterns.

AB Building management systems are designed for energy managers; there are few energy-feedback systems designed to engage staff. A tool, known as e-Genie, was created with the purpose of engaging workplace occupants with energy data and supporting them to take action to reduce energy use. Building on research insights within the field, e-Genie's novel approach encourages users to make plans to meet energy-saving goals, supports discussion and considers social energy behaviours (e.g. discussing energy issues, taking part in campaigns) as well as individual actions. A field-based study of e-Genie indicated that visualizations of energy data were engaging and that the discussion Pinboard' was particularly popular. Pre- andpost-survey (N=77) evaluation of users indicated that people were significantly more concerned about energy issues and reported engaging more in social energy behaviour after about two weeks of e-Genie being installed. Concurrently, objective measures of electricity use decreased over the same period, and continued decreasing over subsequent weeks. Indications are that occupant-facing energy-feedback visualizations can be successful in reducing energy use in the workplace; furthermore, supporting social energy behaviour in the workplace is likely to be a useful direction for promoting action.

Experiential dispositions and technology perceptions around a mobile service that is currently in use to access other value-seeking services are integrated to present an enriched characterization of intention to use m-health. Primary data from a pressing health context in a developing economy are collected to validate the model. The results demonstrate that previous experience from value services received on a mobile service enhances user attention, which in turn positively impacts the perceived usefulness of an incoming m-health program, which then influences user intention to adopt m-health services delivered on that mobile service. Overall, the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of user intention to accept m-health. Additionally, our results provide insights toward the choice of mobile technology and indicate aspects of message framing that may ensure practicable deployment and successful implementation of m-health programs.

Multivariate Behavioral Research, 50, 1-22. doi:10.1080/00273171.2014.962683] introduced an approach to testing a moderated mediation hypothesis based on an index of moderated mediation. Here, I extend this approach to models with more than one moderator. I describe how to test if X's indirect effect on Y is moderated by one variable when a second moderator is held constant (partial moderated mediation), conditioned on (conditional moderated mediation), or dependent on a second moderator (moderated moderated mediation). Examples are provided, as is a discussion of the visualization of indirect effects and an illustration of implementation in the PROCESS macro for SPSS and SAS.

AB Environmental sustainability is the key factor for the future development of the tourism industry, particularly in sensitive rural tourism destinations. Green tourism and green marketing are alternative practices that ensure the environmental sustainability of tourism destinations. However, green marketing has received little attention in the context of rural destinations. This is the first known study undertaken with the purpose of understanding the relationship between green marketing tools (eco-brand, eco-label, and environmental advertisement) and green purchasing behavior in rural tourism destinations from the perception of tourists. A sample of 252 respondents was selected to complete the questionnaires. To assess the developed model, SmartPLS (version 3.2.6) was applied based on path modeling, followed by bootstrapping. The results revealed that the three-dimensional constructs of green marketing tools were significantly and positively correlated with green purchasing behavior of rural tourism destinations from tourists' perspectives. Several implications, limitations, and directions for future research were further discussed.

AB Binge drinking represents a public health issue and is a known risk factor in the development of alcohol use disorders. Previous studies have shown behavioural as well as neuroanatomical alterations associated with binge drinking. Here, we address the question of the automaticity or involuntary nature of the behaviour by assessing goal-directed behaviour and intentionality. In this study, we used a computational two-step task, designed to discern between model-based/goal-directed and model-free/habitual behaviours, and the classic Libet clock task, to study intention awareness, in a sample of 31 severe binge drinkers (BD) and 35 matched healthy volunteers. We observed that BD had impaired goal-directed behaviour in the two-step task compared with healthy volunteers. In the Libet clock task, BD showed delayed intention awareness. Further, we demonstrated that alcohol use severity, as reflected by the alcohol use disorders identification test, correlated with decreased conscious awareness of volitional intention in BD, although it was unrelated to performance on the two-step task. However, the time elapsed since the last drinking binge influenced the model-free scores, with BD showing less habitual behaviour after longer abstinence. Our findings suggest that the implementation of goal-directed strategies and the awareness of volitional intention are affected in current heavy alcohol users. However, the modulation of these impairments by alcohol use severity and abstinence suggests a state effect of alcohol use in these measures and that top-down volitional control might be ameliorated with alcohol use cessation.

AB Although an Internet-of-Things-based smart home solution can provide an improved and better approach to healthcare management, yet its end user adoption is very low. With elderly people as the main target, these conservative users pose a serious challenge to the successful implementation of smart home healthcare services. The objective of this research was to develop and test a theoretical framework empirically for determining the core factors that can affect the elderly users' acceptance of smart home services for healthcare. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted with 254 elderly people aged 55 years and above across four Asian countries. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the effect of eight hypothesized predicting constructs. The user perceptions were measured on a conceptual level rather than the actual usage intention toward a specific service. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, expert advice, and perceived trust have a positive impact on the behavioral intention. The same association is negative for technology anxiety and perceived cost. Facilitating conditions and social influence do not have any effect on the behavioral intention. The model could explain 81.4% of the total variance in the dependent variable i.e., behavioral intention. Effort expectancy is the leading predictor of smart homes for healthcare acceptance among the elderly. Together with expert advice, perceived trust, and perceived cost, these four factors represent the key influence of the elderly peoples' acceptance behavior. This paper provides the groundwork to explore the process of the actual adoption of smart home services for healthcare by the elderly people with potential future research areas.

AB Formation of biological materials is a well-controlled process that is orchestrated by biomolecules such as proteins. Proteins can control the nucleation and mineralization of biomaterials, thereby forming the hard tissues of biological organisms, such as bones, teeth, and shells. In this study, the design and implementation of multifunctional designer proteins are demonstrated for fluorescent silica micro/nanoparticle synthesis. The R5 motif of silaffin polypeptide, which is known for its silicification capability, was fused genetically into three spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins with the intention of forming modified fluorescent proteins. The bifunctional R5 peptide domain served as a tag to provide silica synthesis at ambient conditions. Three functional fusion constructs have been prepared, including GFPmut3-R5, Venus YFP-R5, and mCherry-R5. Recombinant fluorescent proteins were purified using silica-binding peptide tag through silica gel resin. Purified proteins were tested for their binding affinity to silica using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring to make sure they can interact strong enough with the silica surfaces. Later, engineered fluorescent proteins were used to synthesize silica nano/microparticles using silica precursor materials. Synthesized silica particles were investigated for their fluorescence properties, including time-resolved fluorescence. Additionally, elemental analysis of the particles was carried out using electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy. Last, they were tested for their biocompatibility. In this study, we aimed to provide a biomimetic route to synthesize fluorescent silica nanoparticles. Recombinant fluorescent proteins-directed silica nanoparticles synthesis offers a one-step, reliable method to produce fluorescent particles both for biomaterial applications and other nanotechnology applications.

AB Situation selection involves choosing situations based on their likely emotional impact and may be less cognitively taxing or challenging to implement compared to other strategies for regulating emotion, which require people to regulate their emotions in the moment; we thus predicted that individuals who chronically experience intense emotions or who are not particularly competent at employing other emotion regulation strategies would be especially likely to benefit from situation selection. Consistent with this idea, we found that the use of situation selection interacted with individual differences in emotional reactivity and competence at emotion regulation to predict emotional outcomes in both a correlational (Study 1; N=301) and an experimental field study (Study 2; N=125). Taken together, the findings suggest that situation selection is an effective strategy for regulating emotions, especially for individuals who otherwise struggle to do so.

AB While temporary workers' specific employment circumstances strongly suggest negative consequences for their well-being, research on temporary workers' well-being shows serious inconsistencies. To identify possible reasons, we provide an overview of previous well-being research in the temporary work context. The mapping review shows that inconsistencies are caused both by the use of the umbrella term temporary work to describe a wider range of employment forms with divergent characteristics and the use of the buzzword well-being for various well-being indicators. In addition, the portfolio of employment-specific antecedents used is insufficient to gain a comprehensive view of temporary workers' well-being situation. Based on these findings, we propose an agenda for future well-being research in the temporary work context. A first key implication is that analyses considering country-specific circumstances and employment-specific characteristics of particular atypical employment situations are needed. Secondly, a more comprehensive portfolio of employment-specific and individual antecedents would help with gaining deeper insights into temporary workers' well-being situation. In addition, effects of well-being on attitudinal and behavioral outcomes should be analyzed to demonstrate the return on investment of organizations' well-being enhancing activities. Finally, well-being oriented HR practices and their implementation in the temporary work context are part of the proposed research agenda.

AB The unique characteristics of tablet PCs promise important benefits for education. Yet, little is known about the rationale underlying teachers' decisions concerning their educational uses within the constraints of daily classroom practice. The current multiple case study investigated the practical considerations informing nine secondary school teachers' decision-making processes regarding the use of tablet PCs. Stimulated recall interviews revealed 10 criteria underpinning teachers' instructional decisions. Four criteria influenced the degree of congruence with teachers' previous practices: familiarity, alignment with course content, opportunities to achieve (new) instructional goals efficiently, and compatibility with established pedagogical beliefs. Costs and benefits of tablet PCs were determined in terms of educational added value, lesson preparation requirements and potential disruptions to the learning environment. Finally, access to a solid technology infrastructure, supportive school policies and knowledge of how to effectively integrate tablet PCs with course content were identified as important pre-conditions for sustainable implementation. Overall, the results suggest that practical concerns constitute a critical element in teachers' decision making, influencing not only teachers' intention to adopt tablet PCs, but also the ways in which they use this technology to support instruction.

AB Objective: When do people decide to do something about problematic health behaviours? Theoretical models and pragmatic considerations suggest that people should take action when they feel bad about their progress - in other words, when they experience negative progress-related affect. However, the impact of progress-related affect on goal striving has rarely been investigated.
   Design and Methods: Study 1 (N = 744) adopted a cross-sectional design and examined the extent to which measures of progress-related affect were correlated with intentions to take action. Study 2 (N = 409) investigated the impact of manipulating progress-related affect on intentions and behaviour in an experimental design.
   Results: Study 1 found that, while engaging in health behaviours had the expected affective consequences (e.g. people felt bad when they were not eating healthily, exercising regularly or limiting their alcohol consumption), it was feeling good rather than bad about progress that was associated with stronger intentions. Study 2 replicated these findings. Participants induced to feel good about their eating behaviour had marginally stronger intentions to eat healthily than participants led to feel bad about their eating behaviour.
   Conclusion: The findings have implications for interventions designed to promote changes in health behaviour, as well as theoretical frameworks for understanding self-regulation.

AB Transfer of training is one of the oldest topics of interest to industrial and organizational (I/O) psychologists. Drawing on several meta-analytic studies and recent empirical work, we first synthesize what is now reliably known with respect to the generalization and retention of learned knowledge and skills to work contexts. The second part of our review focuses on what is unknown-the significant gaps in our knowledge where we believe new directions in our research strategies are warranted. We offer three prescriptions: (a) going one step beyond most existing studies to offer greater precision in our specification and measurement of variables and interventions, (b) connecting the dots by focusing on transfer criteria and transfer trajectories, and (c) shifting the operative paradigm of research to examine contemporary learning from a problem-centered perspective. There is ample opportunity to increase the yield on enormous organizational investments in training if transfer scholars and practitioners are fully informed of what is known and prepared to systematically confront the unknown in new and innovative ways.

AB Purpose: Get in Motion (GIM) is an evidence-based telephone counseling service that promotes leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) among Canadian adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). The first phase of GIM sustained intentions for, and increased participation in, LTPA; however, it is unclear how GIM led to these outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the implementation correlates of change in LTPA intentions and behavior in the second phase of GIM.
   Methods: The frequency, duration, and content of counseling sessions were tailored to meet clients' (N = 46; 50.0% male; 50.0% paraplegia; 51.46 (SD 12.36) years old) needs and preferences. Intervention dose and content were monitored using Counseling Session Checklists. Clients self-reported their intentions for and actual aerobic and strength-training LTPA participation at baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-months, and their perceptions of service quality at 6-months.
   Results: The second phase of GIM effectively sustained LTPA intentions and increased time spent on moderate-to-vigorous strength-training and total LTPA. Increases in clients' moderate-to-vigorous aerobic LTPA were significantly positively related to intervention dose, intervention content (both informational and behavioral strategies), and clients' perceptions of service credibility.
   Conclusions: This study identified intervention dose and content as key implementation variables for an LTPA telephone counseling service for adults with SCI.

AB Purpose This research aims to explore the factors that affect the adoption of Web 2.0 among knowledge workers. The research specifically investigated the role of factors related to both knowledge seeking and knowledge sharing, in the context of Web 2.0 use by health care professionals.
   Design/methodology/approach For this research, a cross-sectional survey design was adopted. The data were analyzed using the partial least square-structural equation modeling.
   Findings The results confirmed that the intention to adopt Web 2.0 depends upon both the knowledge-seeking and the knowledge-sharing attitudes. However, between the two, it is knowledge-sharing factors that are more important. Health care professionals tend to share knowledge driven by intrinsic motivators rather than by extrinsic motivators. On the other hand, knowledge-seeking attitude was determined by usefulness of knowledge and was not affected by the effort involved.
   Research limitations/implications All the respondents were health care professionals from India, and convenience sampling was used to reach them. This may limit the generalizability of the findings.
   Practical implications This research provides useful insights on implementing Web 2.0-based knowledge management systems, specifically for health care professionals. Particularly, it emphasizes the need to focus on reinforcing intrinsic motivators like self-efficacy and the joy of sharing.
   Originality/value It is perhaps the first study that integrates the factors related to knowledge sharing and seeking in a single theoretical model, thereby presents and tests a more realistic model of knowledge management.

The domains of the Theory of Planned Behavior were significantly associated with general intention to perform oral hygiene care: attitudes (beta = 0.21, p < 0.001), subjective norms (b = 0.38, p < 0.001), perceived behavior control (b = 0.04, p < 0.001); after controlling for personal and environmental factors. Approximately two-thirds (63.4%, 493) reported the performance of some form of oral hygiene care for patients. This behavior was associated with general intention scores (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.05-1.22, p < 0.01), controlling for other factors. Knowledge scores, training, access to oral hygiene guidelines and kits, as well as working ward type were identified as key factors associated with intention and practice of oral hygiene care.
   Conclusion: The Theory of Planned Behavior provides understanding of "intention to" and "performance of" oral hygiene care to stroke patients. Several provider and environmental factors were also associated with intentions and practices. This has implications for understanding and improving the implementation of oral hygiene care in stroke rehabilitation.
